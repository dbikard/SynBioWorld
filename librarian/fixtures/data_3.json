"journal": 240, "abstract": "Background: Global residue-specific amino acid mutagenesis can provide important biological insight and generate proteins with altered properties, but at the risk of protein misfolding. Further, targeted libraries are usually restricted to a handful of amino acids because there is an exponential correlation between the number of residues randomized and the size of the resulting ensemble. Using GFP as the model protein, we present a strategy, termed protein evolution via amino acid and codon elimination, through which simplified, native-like polypeptides encoded by a reduced genetic code were obtained via screening of reduced-size ensembles. Methodology/Principal Findings: The strategy involves combining a sequential mutagenesis scheme to reduce library size with structurally stabilizing mutations, chaperone complementation, and reduced temperature of gene expression. In six steps, we eliminated a common buried residue, Phe, from the green fluorescent protein (GFP), while retaining activity. A GFP variant containing 11 Phe residues was used as starting scaffold to generate 10 separate variants in which each Phe was replaced individually (in one construct two adjacent Phe residues were changed simultaneously), while retaining varying levels of activity. Combination of these substitutions to generate a Phe-free variant of GFP abolished fluorescence. Combinatorial re-introduction of five Phe residues, based on the activities of the respective single amino acid replacements, was sufficient to restore GFP activity. Successive rounds of mutagenesis generated active GFP variants containing, three, two, and zero Phe residues. These GFPs all displayed progenitor-like fluorescence spectra, temperature-sensitive folding, a reduced structural stability and, for the least stable variants, a reduced steady state abundance. Conclusions/Significance: The results provide strategies for the design of novel GFP reporters. The described approach offers a means to enable engineering of active proteins that lack certain amino acids, a key step towards expanding the functional repertoire of uniquely labeled proteins in synthetic biology."}},{"pk": "267", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "153", "pubYear": 2010, "doi": "10.1104/pp.109.152249", "sbw": 0, "title": "MISSA Is a Highly Efficient in Vivo DNA Assembly Method for Plant Multiple-Gene Transformation", "pubMonth": "5", "journal": 266, "abstract": "We describe a highly efficient in vivo DNA assembly method, multiple-round in vivo site-specific assembly (MISSA), which facilitates plant multiple-gene transformation.

One of these vectors was generated by 15 rounds of MISSA reactions and was confirmed in transgenic Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). As MISSA simplifies the tedious and time-consuming in vitro manipulations to a simple mixing of bacterial strains, it will greatly save time, effort, and expense associated with the assembly of multiple transgenic or synthetic DNA. The principle that underlies MISSA is applicable to engineering polygenic traits, biosynthetic pathways, or protein complexes in all organisms, such as Escherichia coli, yeast, plants, and animals.

A successful strategy common to most of these experiments is their focus on modular interactions between protein domains or domains and peptide motifs. Such modular interaction swapping has rewired signaling in yeast, put mammalian cell morphology under the control of light, or increased the flux through a synthetic metabolic pathway.

We investigate how selection for high-affinity aptamers is constrained by chemical properties of the ligand and the need to bind in low magnesium. We select two sets of RNA aptamers that bind planar ligands with dissociation constants (K(d)s) ranging from 65 nM to 100 mu M in physiological buffer conditions. Aptamers selected to bind the non-proteinogenic amino acid, p-amino phenylalanine (pAF), are larger and more informationally complex (i.e., rarer in a pool of random sequences) than aptamers selected to bind a larger fluorescent dye, tetramethylrhodamine (TMR). Interestingly, tighter binding aptamers show less dependence on magnesium than weaker-binding aptamers. Thus, selection for high-affinity binding may automatically lead to structures that are functional in physiological conditions (1-2.5 mM Mg2+). We hypothesize that selection for high-affinity binding in physiological conditions is primarily constrained by ligand characteristics such as molecular weight (MW) and the number of rotatable bonds.

The Muller C-element is a standard logic gate commonly used to synchronize independent processes in most asynchronous electronic circuits. Synthetic biological logic gates have been previously demonstrated, but there remain many open issues in the design of sequential (state-holding) logic operations. Three designs are considered for the genetic Muller C-element: a majority gate, a toggle switch, and a speed-independent implementation. While the three designs are logically equivalent, each design requires different assumptions to operate correctly. The majority gate design requires the most timing assumptions, the speed-independent design requires the least, and the toggle switch design is a compromise between the two. This paper examines the robustness of these designs as well as the effects of parameter variation using stochastic simulation. The results show that robustness to timing assumptions does not necessarily increase reliability, suggesting that modifications to existing logic design tools are going to be necessary for synthetic biology. Parameter variation simulations yield further insights into the design principles necessary for building robust genetic gates. The results suggest that high gene count, cooperativity of at least two, tight repression, and balanced decay rates are necessary for robust gates.

Among the elements forming regulatory networks in bacteria are regulatory proteins such as transcription factors, which respond to exogenous and endogenous conditions. To perceive their surroundings, bacteria have evolved sensory regulatory systems of two-components. The archetype of these systems is made up of two proteins a signal sensor and a response regulator whose genes are usually located together in a single transcription unit. These units switch transcriptional programs in response to environmental conditions. Here, we study 14 two-component systems in Escherichia coil, which have been experimentally characterized with respect to their transcriptional regulation and their perceived signal. Given that the activity of these sensory units is connected to the rest of the transcriptional network, we first classify them as autonomous, semiautonomous or dependent, according to whether or not they use additional regulators to be transcribed. Next, we use discrete-time models to simulate their qualitative regulatory dynamics in response to their transcriptional regulation and to the activation of these systems by their cognate signals. Compared to more traditional ordinary differential equations method, ours has the advantage of being computationally simple and mathematically tractable, while keeping the ability to reproduce the phenomenology described by non-linear models. The aim of the present work is not the study of all possible behaviors of these two-component systems, but to exemplify those behaviors reported in the literature. On the other hand, most of these systems are auto-activating switches, a property that distinguishes them from the other transcription factors in the regulatory network, which are mostly auto-repressing. Based on the data, our models show dynamic behaviors that explain how most of these sensory systems convey abilities for multistationarity, and these dynamic properties could explain the phenotypic heterogeneity observed in bacterial populations.

Heterologous expression of novel combinations of enzymes promises to provide new or improved synthetic routes towards a substantially increased diversity of small molecules. Recently, we constructed a synthetic pathway to produce D-glucaric acid, a molecule that has been deemed a \"top-value added chemical'' from biomass, starting from glucose. Limiting flux through the pathway is the second recombinant step, catalyzed by myo-inositol oxygenase (MIOX), whose activity is strongly influenced by the concentration of the myo-inositol substrate. To synthetically increase the effective concentration of myo-inositol, polypeptide scaffolds were built from protein-protein interaction domains to co-localize all three pathway enzymes in a designable complex as previously described (Dueber et al., 2009). Glucaric acid titer was found to be strongly affected by the number of scaffoldinteraction domains targeting upstream Ino1 enzymes, whereas the effect of increased numbers of MIOX-targeted domains was much less significant. We determined that the scaffolds directly increased the specific MIOX activity and that glucaric acid titers were strongly correlated with MIOX activity.

The major challenge in this field is to reliably control stem cell behavior outside the body. Common biological col trol schemes often ignore physicochemical parameters that materials scientists and engineers commonly manipulate, such as substrate topography and mechanical and rheological properties.

A biomimetic stem cell control strategy is often limited by an incomplete understanding of the complex signaling pathways that drive stem cell behavior from early embryogenesis to late adulthood. The stem cell extracellular environment presents a miscellany of competing biological signals that keep the cell in a state of unstable equilibrium. Using synthetic polymers, researchers have designed synthetic microenvironments with an uncluttered array of cell signals, both specific and nonspecific, that are motivated by rather than modeled after biology.

We use aqueous drops dispersed in oil as picoliter-volume reaction vessels and screen them at rates of thousands per second. To demonstrate its power, we apply the system to directed evolution, identifying new mutants of the enzyme horseradish peroxidase exhibiting catalytic rates more than 10 times faster than their parent, which is already a very efficient enzyme. We exploit the ultrahigh throughput to use an initial purifying selection that removes inactive mutants, we identify similar to 100 variants comparable in activity to the parent from an initial population of similar to 10(7). After a second generation of mutagenesis and high-stringency screening, we identify several significantly improved mutants, some approaching diffusion-limited efficiency. In total, we screen similar to 10(8) individual enzyme reactions in only 10 h, using <150 mu L of total reagent volume, compared to state-of-the-art robotic screening systems, we perform the entire assay with a 1,000-fold increase in speed and a 1-million-fold reduction in cost."}},{"pk": "1250", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "107", "pubYear": 2010, "doi": "10.1073/pnas.0914595107", "sbw": 0, "title": "Function and specificity of synthetic Hox transcription factors in vivo", "pubMonth": "3", "journal": 878, "abstract": "Homeotic (Hox) genes encode transcription factors that confer segmental identity along the anteroposterior axis of the embryo.

Here, we provide guidelines for chemotaxis pathway design by employing control theory and reverse engineering concept on pathway dynamic design. We first analyzed the mathematical models for two most important kinds of E. coli chemotaxis pathway-adaptive and non-adaptive pathways, and concluded that the control units of the pathway de facto function as a band-pass filter and a low-pass filter, respectively, by abstracting the frequency response properties of the pathways. The advantage of the band-pass filter is established, and we demonstrate how to tune the three key parameters of it-A (max amplification), omega(1) (down cut-off frequency) and omega(2) (up cut-off frequency) to optimize the chemotactic effect. Finally, we hypothesized a similar but simpler version of the dynamic pathway model based on the principles discovered and show that it leads to similar properties with native E. coli chemotactic behaviors.

The prototype microreactor is based on a 200-mu m ID fused silica capillary for quantitative kinetic analysis. The concept is based on the reversible immobilization of His(6)-tagged enzymes via Ni-NTA linkage to surface derivatized silica. For the initial microreactor design, the mode of operation is a stop-flow analysis which promotes higher degrees of conversion. Kinetics for the immobilized TK-catalysed synthesis of L-erythrulose from substrates glycolaldehyde (GA) and hydroxypyruvate (HPA) were evaluated based on a Michaelis-Menten model. Results show that the TK kinetic parameters in the IEMR (V-max(app) = 0.1 +/- 0.02 mmol min(-1), K-m(app) = 26 +/- 4 mM) are comparable with those measured in free solution. Furthermore, the k(cat) for the microreactor of 4.1 x 10(5) s(-1) was close to the value for the bioconversion in free solution.

The ability to quantify kinetic parameters of engineered enzymes at this scale has benefits for the rapid and parallel evaluation of evolved enzyme libraries for synthetic biology applications and for the generation of kinetic models to aid bioconversion process design and bioreactor selection as a more efficient alternative to previously established microwell-based systems for TK bioprocess characterization.

The model shows that, depending on the actual kinetic parameters, TCSs exhibit all-or-none, graded or mixed mode responses. In accordance with other studies, positively autoregulated TCSs exhibit all-or-none responses. Unexpectedly, our model revealed that TCSs lacking a positive feedback loop exhibit not only graded but also mixed mode responses, in which variation of the signal strength alters the level of gene expression in induced cells while the regulated gene continues to be expressed at the basal level in a substantial fraction of cells. The graded response of the TCS changes to mixed mode response by an increase of the translation initiation rate of the histidine kinase. Thus, a TCS is an evolvable design pattern capable of implementing deterministic regulation and stochastic switches associated with both graded and threshold responses. This has implications for understanding the emergence of population diversity in pathogenic bacteria and the design of genetic circuits in synthetic biology applications.

For example, to synthesize a gene regulatory network, the derivation of a mathematical model is important in order to carry out in silico investigations of the network dynamics and to investigate parameter variations and robustness issues. Different mathematical frameworks have been proposed to derive such models. In particular, the use of sets of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) has been proposed to model the dynamics of the concentrations of mRNAs and proteins. These models are usually characterized by the presence of highly nonlinear Hill function terms. A typical simplification is to reduce the number of equations by means of a quasi-steady-state assumption on the mRNA concentrations. This yields a class of simplified ODE models. A radically different approach is to replace the Hill functions by piecewise-linear approximations [Casey, R., de Jong, H., Gouze, J.-L., 2006. Piecewise-linear models of genetic regulatory networks: equilibria and their stability. J. Math. Biol. 52( 1), 27-56]. A further modelling approach is the use of discrete-time maps [Coutinho, R., Fernandez, B., Lima, R., Meyroneinc, A., 2006. Discrete time piecewise affine models of genetic regulatory networks. J. Math. Biol. 52, 524-570] where the evolution of the system is modelled in discrete, rather than continuous, time. The aim of this paper is to discuss and compare these different modelling approaches, using a representative gene regulatory network. We will show that different models often lead to conflicting conclusions concerning the existence and stability of equilibria and stable oscillatory behaviours. Moreover, we shall discuss, where possible, the viability of making certain modelling approximations( e. g. quasi-steady-state mRNA dynamics or piecewise-linear approximations of Hill functions) and their effects on the overall system dynamics.

Cell-free SyPaB, as compared to microbial fermentation, has several distinctive advantages, such as high product yield, great engineering flexibility, high product titer, and fast reaction rate. Biocommodities (e.g., ethanol, hydrogen, and butanol) are low-value products where costs of feedstock carbohydrates often account for similar to 30-70% of the prices of the products. Therefore, yield of biocommodities is the most important cost factor, and the lowest yields of profitable biofuels are estimated to be ca. 70% of the theoretical yields of sugar-to-biofuels based on sugar prices of ca. US$ 0.18 per kg. The opinion that SyPaB is too costly for producing low-value biocommodities are mainly attributed to the lack of stable standardized building blocks (e.g., enzymes or their complexes), costly labile coenzymes, and replenishment of enzymes and coenzymes. In this perspective, I propose design principles for SyPaB, present several SyPaB examples for generating hydrogen, alcohols, and electricity, and analyze the advantages and limitations of SyPaB. The economical analyses clearly suggest that developments in stable enzymes or their complexes as standardized parts, efficient coenzyme recycling, and, use of low-cost and more stable biomimetic coenzyme analogs, would result in much lower production costs than do microbial fermentations because the stabilized enzymes have more than 3 orders of magnitude higher weight-based total turn-over numbers than microbial biocatalysts, although extra costs for enzyme purification and stabilization are spent.

Analogous to widely used 2',3'-dideoxynucleoside triphosphates (ddNTPs), dNTP-ONH(2)s terminate primer extension. Unlike ddNTPs, however, primer extension can be resumed by cleaving an O-N bond to restore an -OH group to the 3'-end of the primer. REAP combined with crystallographic analyses identified 35 sites where replacements might improve the ability of Taq to accept dNTP-ONH(2)s. A library of 93 Taq variants, each having replacements at three or four of these sites, held eight variants having improved ability to accept dNTP-ONH2 substrates. Two of these (A597T, L616A, F667Y, E745H, and E520G, K540I, L616A) performed notably well. The second variant incorporated both dNTP-ONH(2)sand ddNTPs faithfully and efficiently, supporting extension-cleavage-extension cycles applicable in parallel sequencing and in SNP detection through competition between reversible and irreversible terminators. Dissecting these results showed that one replacement (L616A), not previously identified, allows Taq to incorporate both reversible and irreversible terminators.

They are evolutionarily determined by variables such as environment stability, nutrient availability, and community diversity. Selection for fast growth adaptively imprints genomes, resulting in gene amplification, adapted chromosomal organization, and biased codon usage. We found that these growth-related traits in 214 species of bacteria and archaea are highly correlated, suggesting they all result from growth optimization. While modeling their association with maximal growth rates in view of synthetic biology applications, we observed that codon usage biases are better correlates of growth rates than any other trait, including rRNA copy number. Systematic deviations to our model reveal two distinct evolutionary processes. First, genome organization shows more evolutionary inertia than growth rates. This results in over-representation of growth-related traits in fast degrading genomes. Second, selection for these traits depends on optimal growth temperature: for similar generation times purifying selection is stronger in psychrophiles, intermediate in mesophiles, and lower in thermophiles. Using this information, we created a predictor of maximal growth rate adapted to small genome fragments. We applied it to three metagenomic environmental samples to show that a transiently rich environment, as the human gut, selects for fast-growers, that a toxic environment, as the acid mine biofilm, selects for low growth rates, whereas a diverse environment, like the soil, shows all ranges of growth rates. We also demonstrate that microbial colonizers of babies gut grow faster than stabilized human adults gut communities. In conclusion, we show that one can predict maximal growth rates from sequence data alone, and we propose that such information can be used to facilitate the manipulation of generation times. Our predictor allows inferring growth rates in the vast majority of uncultivable prokaryotes and paves the way to the understanding of community dynamics from metagenomic data."}},{"pk": "1963", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "9", "pubYear": 2010, "doi": "10.1186/1475-2859-9-3", "sbw": 1, "title": "The path to next generation biofuels: successes and challenges in the era of synthetic biology", "pubMonth": "1", "journal": 1962, "abstract": "Volatility of oil prices along with major concerns about climate change, oil supply security and depleting reserves have sparked renewed interest in the production of fuels from renewable resources.

Here, we measure the effects of tandem copies of a small (18 bp) Class II T7 terminator from vesicular stomatitis virus on transcription in vitro and on translation in vitro and in vivo. We first test monomeric and dimeric gene constructs, then attempt extension to pentameric gene constructs. \"BioBrick\" versions of a pET vector and translation factor genes were constructed to facilitate cloning, and His-tags were incorporated to allow copurification of all protein products for relatively unbiased analysis and easy purification. Several results were surprising, including imbalanced expression of the pentameric constructs in vivo, illustrating the value of synthetic biology for investigating gene expression.

Synthetic genetic networks producing bistability and oscillations have been designed and constructed experimentally. However, in real biological systems, regulatory circuits are usually interconnected and the dynamics of those complex networks is often richer than the dynamics of simple modules. Here we couple the genetic Toggle switch and the Repressilator, two prototypic systems exhibiting bistability and oscillations, respectively. We study two types of coupling. In the first type, the bistable switch is under the control of the oscillator. Numerical simulation of this system allows us to determine the conditions under which a periodic switch between the two stable steady states of the Toggle switch occurs. In addition we show how birhythmicity characterized by the coexistence of two stable small-amplitude limit cycles, can easily be obtained in the system. In the second type of coupling, the oscillator is placed under the control of the Toggle switch. Numerical simulation of this system shows that this construction could for example be exploited to generate a permanent transition from a stable steady state to self-sustained oscillations (and vice versa) after a transient external perturbation. Those results thus describe qualitative dynamical behaviors that can be generated through the coupling of two simple network modules. These results differ from the dynamical properties resulting from interlocked feedback loops systems in which a given variable is involved at the same time in both positive and negative feedbacks.

This prediction was experimentally tested by constructing a synthetic genetic circuit in Escherichia coli containing two well-characterized positive feedback loops, linked in a coherent fashion. The concerted action of both positive feedback loops resulted in bistable behavior over a broad range of inducer concentrations, when either of the feedback loops was removed, the range of inducer concentrations at which the system exhibited bistability was decreased by an order of magnitude. Furthermore, bistability of the system could be tuned by altering growth conditions that regulate the contribution of one of the feedback loops.

Peptide bond conformation as well as puckering propensity can be manipulated by proper choice of ring substituents, e. g. C-gamma-fluorination. Synthetic chemistry has routinely exploited ring-substituted proline analogs in order to change, modulate or control folding and stability of peptides. Methodology/Principal Findings: In order to transmit this synthetic strategy to complex proteins, the ten proline residues of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were globally replaced by (4R)- and (4S)-fluoroprolines (FPro). By this approach, we expected to affect the cis/trans peptidyl-proline bond isomerization and pyrrolidine ring puckering, which are responsible for the slow folding of this protein. Expression of both protein variants occurred at levels comparable to the parent protein, but the (4R)-FPro-EGFP resulted in irreversibly unfolded inclusion bodies, whereas the (4S)-FPro-EGFP led to a soluble fluorescent protein. Upon thermal denaturation, refolding of this variant occurs at significantly higher rates than the parent EGFP. Comparative inspection of the X-ray structures of EGFP and (4S)-FPro-EGFP allowed to correlate the significantly improved refolding with the C-gamma-endo puckering of the pyrrolidine rings, which is favored by 4S-fluorination, and to lesser extents with the cis/trans isomerization of the prolines. Conclusions/Significance: We discovered that the folding rates and stability of GFP are affected to a lesser extent by cis/trans isomerization of the proline bonds than by the puckering of pyrrolidine rings. In the C-gamma-endo conformation the fluorine atoms are positioned in the structural context of the GFP such that a network of favorable local interactions is established. From these results the combined use of synthetic amino acids along with detailed structural knowledge and existing protein engineering methods can be envisioned as a promising strategy for the design of complex tailor-made proteins and even cellular structures of superior properties compared to the native forms."}},{"pk": "2496", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "3", "pubYear": 2008, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0002671", "sbw": 9, "title": "Targeted Development of Registries of Biological Parts", "pubMonth": "7", "journal": 240, "abstract": "Background: The design and construction of novel biological systems by combining basic building blocks represents a dominant paradigm in synthetic biology.

Methods/Principal Findings: By analyzing inclusion relationships between the sequences of the Registry entries, we build a network that can be related to the Registry abstraction hierarchy. The distribution of entry reuse and complexity was extracted from this network. The collection of clones associated with the database entries was also analyzed. The plasmid inserts were amplified and sequenced. The sequences of 162 inserts could be confirmed experimentally but unexpected discrepancies have also been identified. Conclusions/Significance: Organizational guidelines are proposed to help design and manage this new type of scientific resources. In particular, it appears necessary to compare the cost of ensuring the integrity of database entries and associated biological samples with their value to the users.

To produce these energy-rich products, a substrate is needed that feeds in reductive equivalents, When photosynthetic microorganisms learned to use water as a substrate some 2 billion years ago, a fundamental barrier against unlimited use of solar energy was overcome. The possibility of solar energy use has inspired researchers to construct artificial photosynthetic systems that show analogy to parts of the intricate molecular machinery of photosynthesis. Recent years have seen a reorientation of efforts toward creating integrated light-to-fuel systems that can use solar energy for direct synthesis of energy-rich compounds, so-called solar fuels. Sustainable production of solar fuels is a long awaited development that promises extensive solar energy use combined with long-term storage. The stoichiometry of water splitting into molecular oxygen, protons, and electrons is deceptively simple, achieving it by chemical catalysis has proven remarkably difficult. The reaction center Photosystem II couples light-induced charge separation to an efficient molecular water-splitting catalyst, a Mn4Ca complex, and is thus an important template for biomimetic chemistry. In our aims to design biomimetic manganese complexes for light-driven water oxidation, we link photosensitizers and charge-separation motifs to potential catalysts in supramolecular assemblies. In photosynthesis, production of carbohydrates demands the delivery of multiple reducing equivalents to CO2. In contrast, the two-electron reduction of protons to molecular hydrogen is much less demanding. Virtually all microorganisms have enzymes called hydrogenases that convert protons to hydrogen, many of them with good catalytic efficiency. The catalytic sites of hydrogenases are now the center of attention of biomimetic efforts, providing prospects for catalytic hydrogen production with inexpensive metals. Thus, we might complete the water-to-fuel conversion: light + 2H(2)O -> 2H(2) + O-2 This reaction formula is to some extent already elegantly fulfilled by cyanobacteria and green algae, water-splitting photosynthetic microorganisms that under certain conditions also can produce hydrogen. An alternative route to hydrogen from solar energy is therefore to engineer these organisms to produce hydrogen more efficiently. This Account describes our original approach to combine research in these two fields: mimicking structural and functional principles of both Photosystem II and hydrogenases by synthetic chemistry and engineering cyanobacteria to become better hydrogen producers and ultimately developing new routes toward synthetic biology."}},{"pk": "2599", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "6", "pubYear": 2010, "doi": "10.1039/b909200p", "sbw": 1, "title": "Incorporation of unnatural amino acids for synthetic biology", "pubMonth": "0", "journal": 1661, "abstract": "The challenge of synthetic biology lies in the construction of artificial cellular systems.

The Cl. thermocellum ORF Cthe1265 encoding a putative PGM was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified enzyme appeared to be a monomer with an estimated molecular weight of 64 center dot 9 kDa. This enzyme was found to be a dual-specificity enzyme - PGM/phosphomannomutase (PMM).

By altering the chemical characteristics of the ribose at A2451 by replacing its 2'-OH with selected functional groups demonstrated that hydrogen donor capability is essential for efficient transpeptidation. These findings in combination with data that accumulated over the past years allowed to propose a comprehensive model for peptide bond synthesis in which the A2451 2'-OH directly assists in positioning one of the tRNA substrates via hydrogen-bond formation and thus supports amide bond synthesis via a proton shuttle mechanism.

In Part I of this series, we proposed a theoretical framework integrating the concepts of developmental biology with those of process design to provide the rules for the design of biomimetic processes. We named this methodology \"developmental engineering'' to emphasize that it is not the tissue but the process of in vitro tissue development that has to be engineered. To formulate the process design rules in a rigorous way that will allow a computational design, we should refer to mathematical methods to model the biological process taking place in vitro. Tissue functions cannot be attributed to individual molecules but rather to complex interactions between the numerous components of a cell and interactions between cells in a tissue that form a network. For tissue engineering to advance to the level of a technologically driven discipline amenable to well-established principles of process engineering, a scientifically rigorous formulation is needed of the general design rules so that the behavior of networks of genes, proteins, or cells that govern the unfolding of developmental processes could be related to the design parameters. Now that sufficient experimental data exist to construct plausible mathematical models of many biological control circuits, explicit hypotheses can be evaluated using computational approaches to facilitate process design. Recent progress in systems biology has shown that the empirical concepts of developmental biology that we used in Part I to extract the rules of biomimetic process design can be expressed in rigorous mathematical terms. This allows the accurate characterization of manufacturing processes in tissue engineering as well as the properties of the artificial tissues themselves. In addition, network science has recently shown that the behavior of biological networks strongly depends on their topology and has developed the necessary concepts and methods to describe it, allowing therefore a deeper understanding of the behavior of networks during biomimetic processes. These advances thus open the door to a transition for tissue engineering from a substantially empirical endeavor to a technology-based discipline comparable to other branches of engineering."}},{"pk": "2922", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "396", "pubYear": 2010, "doi": "10.1016/j.ab.2009.08.033", "sbw": 0, "title": "A universal approach for promoter strength evaluation supported by the web-based tool PromCal", "pubMonth": "1", "journal": 2921, "abstract": "In genetic engineering, gene expression is often modulated by replacements in promoter regions.

This concept provides a finer level of granularity than the traditional notion of the gene. However, a method of formally relating how a set of parts relates to a function has not yet emerged. Synthetic biology both demands such a formalism and provides an ideal setting for testing hypotheses about relationships between DNA sequences and phenotypes beyond the gene-centric methods used in genetics. Attribute grammars are used in computer science to translate the text of a program source code into the computational operations it represents. By associating attributes with parts, modifying the value of these attributes using rules that describe the structure of DNA sequences, and using a multi-pass compilation process, it is possible to translate DNA sequences into molecular interaction network models. These capabilities are illustrated by simple example grammars expressing how gene expression rates are dependent upon single or multiple parts. The translation process is validated by systematically generating, translating, and simulating the phenotype of all the sequences in the design space generated by a small library of genetic parts. Attribute grammars represent a flexible framework connecting parts with models of biological function.

This coincides with direct confirmation of the preponderance of long interspersed elements in mammalian genomes at the nucleotide level by large scale sequencing efforts. Two assay systems have been prominently featured in L1 studies over the past decade, which are used to assess L1 activities in cultured cells and transgenic mice respectively. However, constructing retrotransposon assay vectors and subsequent mapping of integration sites remain technically challenging aspects of the field. Synthetic biology approaches have changed the playing field with regard to the strategic design of retrotransposons. To streamline the construction and optimization of synthetic retrotransposons, we have implemented a highly efficient modular design for L1 vectors allowing \"plug and play\" swapping of individual modules as new knowledge is gained and optimization of constructs proceeds. Seven functional modules are divided by strategically placed unique restriction sites. These are utilized to facilitate module exchange and construction of L1 vectors for gene targeting, transgenesis and cell culture assays. A \"double Sfil\" strategy utilizing two non-complementary overhangs allows insert swapping to be carried out with a single, robust restriction/ligation cycle. The double-Sfil strategy is generic and can be applied to many other problems in synthetic biology or genetic engineering. To facilitate genomic mapping of LI insertions, we have developed an optimized inverse PCR protocol using 4-base cutters and step-down cycling conditions. Using this protocol, de nova L1 insertions can be efficiently recovered after a single round of PCR. The proposed modular design also incorporates features allowing streamlined insertion mapping without repeated optimization. Furthermore, we have presented evidence that efficient L1 retrotransposition is not dependent on pCEP4 conferred autonomous replication capabilities when a shortened puromycin selection protocol is used, providing a great opportunity for further optimization of L1 cell culture assay vectors by using alternative vector backbones.

So far biologists identified two necessary conditions for bistability: positive feedback and ultrasensitivity. Results: Biological systems are based upon elementary mono- and bimolecular chemical reactions. In order to definitely clarify all necessary conditions for bistability we here present the corresponding minimal system. According to our definition, it contains the minimal number of (i) reactants, (ii) reactions, and (iii) terms in the corresponding ordinary differential equations (decreasing importance from i-iii). The minimal bistable system contains two reactants and four irreversible reactions (three bimolecular, one monomolecular). We discuss the roles of the reactions with respect to the necessary conditions for bistability: two reactions comprise the positive feedback loop, a third reaction filters out small stimuli thus enabling a stable 'off' state, and the fourth reaction prevents explosions. We argue that prevention of explosion is a third general necessary condition for bistability, which is so far lacking discussion in the literature. Moreover, in addition to proving that in two-component systems three steady states are necessary for bistability (five for tristability, etc.), we also present a simple general method to design such systems: one just needs one production and three different degradation mechanisms (one production, five degradations for tristability, etc.). This helps modelling multistable systems and it is important for corresponding synthetic biology projects. Conclusion: The presented minimal bistable system finally clarifies the often discussed question for the necessary conditions for bistability. The three necessary conditions are: positive feedback, a mechanism to filter out small stimuli and a mechanism to prevent explosions. This is important for modelling bistability with simple systems and for synthetically designing new bistable systems. Our simple model system is also well suited for corresponding teaching purposes."}},{"pk": "3242", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "5", "pubYear": 2009, "doi": "10.1002/smll.200900667", "sbw": 0, "title": "A Self-Assembled Protein Nanotube with High Aspect Ratio", "pubMonth": "9", "journal": 3241, "abstract": "Production of a self-assembled protein nanotube achieved through engineering of the 11mer ring protein trp RNA-binding attenuation protein is described.

The ortho substituents of these nucleotides are included to facilitate unnatural base pair extension, presumably by forming a hydrogen-bond with the polymerase, but the synthesis of the unnatural base pair still requires optimization. Recently, we have shown that meta and/or para substituents within the dMMO2 scaffold can facilitate unnatural base pair synthesis, although the mechanism remains unclear. To explore this issue, we synthesized and evaluated several dMMO2 derivatives with meta-chlorine, -bromine, -iodine, -methyl, or -propinyl substituents. Complete characterization of unnatural base pair and mispair synthesis and extension reveal that the modifications have large effects only on the efficiency of unnatural base pair synthesis and that the effects likely result from a combination of changes in steric interactions, polarity, and polarizability. The results also suggest that functionalized versions of the propinyl moiety of d5PrM should serve as suitable linkers to site-specifically incorporate other chemical functionalities into DNA.

However, the development of synthetic gene networks is still difficult and most newly created gene networks are non-functioning due to intrinsic parameter uncertainties, external disturbances and functional variations of intra- and extra-cellular environments. The design method for a robust synthetic gene network that works properly in a host cell under these intrinsic parameter uncertainties and external disturbances is the most important topic in synthetic biology. Results: In this study, we propose a stochastic model that includes parameter fluctuations and external disturbances to mimic the dynamic behaviors of a synthetic gene network in the host cell. Then, based on this stochastic model, four design specifications are introduced to guarantee that a synthetic gene network can achieve its desired steady state behavior in spite of parameter fluctuations, external disturbances and functional variations in the host cell. We propose a systematic method to select a set of appropriate design parameters for a synthetic gene network that will satisfy these design specifications so that the intrinsic parameter fluctuations can be tolerated, the external disturbances can be efficiently filtered, and most importantly, the desired steady states can be achieved. Thus the synthetic gene network can work properly in a host cell under intrinsic parameter uncertainties, external disturbances and functional variations. Finally, a design procedure for the robust synthetic gene network is developed and a design example is given in silico to confirm the performance of the proposed method. Conclusion: Based on four design specifications, a systematic design procedure is developed for designers to engineer a robust synthetic biology network that can achieve its desired steady state behavior under parameter fluctuations, external disturbances and functional variations in the host cell. Therefore, the proposed systematic design method has good potential for the robust synthetic gene network design."}},{"pk": "3547", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "25", "pubYear": 2009, "doi": "10.1093/bioinformatics/btp401", "sbw": 0, "title": "Antimony: a modular model definition language", "pubMonth": "9", "journal": 1011, "abstract": "Motivation: Model exchange in systems and synthetic biology has been standardized for computers with the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) and CellML, but specialized software is needed for the generation of models in these formats.

The most prominent representation of synthetic biology has so far been microbial engineering by recombinant DNA technology, employing modular concepts known from information technology. However, there are an increasing number of biophysical groups who follow similar strategies of dissecting cellular processes and networks, trying to identify functional minimal modules that could then be combined in a bottom-up approach towards biology. These modules are so far not as particularly defined by their impact on DNA processing, but rather influenced by core fields of biophysics, such as cell mechanics and membrane dynamics. This review will give an overview of some classical and some quite new biophysical strategies for constructing minimal systems of certain cellular modules.

Because of this, their performance is determined by the tradeoff inherent to their switching thermodynamics, while a switching equilibrium constant favoring the nonbinding, nonsignaling, conformation ensures a larger signal change (more molecules are poised to respond), it also reduces affinity (binding must overcome a more unfavorable conformational free energy). We then derive and employ the relationship between switching thermodynamics and switch signaling to rationally tune the dynamic range and detection limit of a representative structure-switching biosensor, a molecular beacon, over 4 orders of magnitude. These findings demonstrate that the performance of biomolecular switches can be rationally tuned via mutations that alter their switching thermodynamics and suggest a mechanism by which the performance of naturally occurring switches may have evolved."}},{"pk": "3659", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "48", "pubYear": 2009, "doi": "10.1002/anie.200902182", "sbw": 1, "title": "Microfluidic Formation of Monodisperse, Cell-Sized, and Unilamellar Vesicles", "pubMonth": "0", "journal": 429, "abstract": ""}},{"pk": "3690", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "4", "pubYear": 2009, "doi": "10.1021/cb900109w", "sbw": 1, "title": "A Synthetic Protein Selected for Ligand Binding Affinity Mediates ATP Hydrolysis", "pubMonth": "8", "journal": 3689, "abstract": "How primitive enzymes emerged from a primordial pool remains a fundamental uranswered question with Important practical implications in synthetic biology.

It is implied that such a system with interlinked positive and negative feedback loops is a flexible motif that can modulate itself among various functions. Here, we developed a minimal model for the system and systematically explored its dynamics and performance advantage in response to stimuli in a unifying framework. The system indeed displays diverse behaviors when the strength of feedback loops is changed. First, the system can be tunable from monostability to bistability by increasing the strength of positive feedback, and the bistability regime is modulated by the strength of negative feedback. Second, the system undergoes transitions from bistability to excitability and to oscillation with increasing the strength of negative feedback, and the reverse conversion occurs by enhancing the strength of positive feedback. Third, the system is more flexible than a single feedback loop, it can produce robust larger-amplitude oscillations over a wider stimulus regime compared with a single time-delayed negative feedback loop. Furthermore, the tunability of the system depends mainly on the topology of coupled feedback loops but less on the exact parameter values or the mode of interactions between model components.

The canonical system consists of a membrane-bound sensor histidine kinase that autophosphorylates in response to a signal and transfers the phosphate to an intracellular response regulator. Bacteria typically have dozens of two-component systems. The key questions are whether these systems are linear and, if they are, how cross talk between systems is buffered. In this work, we studied the EnvZ/OmpR and CpxA/CpxR systems from Escherichia coli, which have been shown previously to exhibit slow cross talk in vitro. Using in vitro radiolabeling and a rapid quenched-flow apparatus, we experimentally measured 10 biochemical parameters capturing the cognate and non-cognate phosphotransfer reactions between the systems. These data were used to parameterize a mathematical model that was used to predict how cross talk is affected as different genes are knocked out. It was predicted that significant cross talk between EnvZ and CpxR only occurs for the triple mutant Delta ompR Delta cpxA Delta actA-pta. All seven combinations of these knockouts were made to test this prediction and only the triple mutant demonstrated significant cross talk, where the cpxP promoter was induced 280-fold upon the activation of EnvZ. Furthermore, the behavior of the other knockouts agrees with the model predictions. These results support a kinetic model of buffering where both the cognate bifunctional phosphatase activity and the competition between regulator proteins for phosphate prevent cross talk in vivo.

We introduce such a programming language, which allows logical interactions between potentially undetermined proteins and genes to be expressed in a modular manner. Programs can be translated by a compiler into sequences of standard biological parts, a process that relies on logic programming and prototype databases that contain known biological parts and protein interactions. Programs can also be translated to reactions, allowing simulations to be carried out.

Perhaps the most important aspect of modelling is to follow a clear design methodology that will help to highlight unwanted deficiencies. The use of tools designed to aid the modelling process can be of benefit in many situations. In this paper, the modelling approach called systemic computation (SC) is introduced. SC is an interaction-based language, which enables individual-based expression and modelling of biological systems, and the interactions between them. SC permits a precise description of a hypothetical mechanism to be written using an intuitive graph-based or a calculus-based notation. The same description can then be directly run as a simulation, merging the hypothetical mechanism and the simulation into the same entity. However, even when using well-designed modelling tools to produce good models, the best model is not always the most accurate one. Frequently, computational constraints or lack of data make it infeasible to model an aspect of biology. Simplification may provide one way forward, but with inevitable consequences of decreased accuracy. Instead of attempting to replace an element with a simpler approximation, it is sometimes possible to substitute the element with a different but functionally similar component. In the second part of this paper, this modelling approach is described and its advantages are summarized using an exemplar: the fractal protein model. Finally, the paper ends with a discussion of good biological modelling practice by presenting lessons learned from the use of SC and the fractal protein model."}},{"pk": "4280", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "6", "pubYear": 2009, "doi": "10.1098/rsif.2008.0520.focus", "sbw": 3, "title": "You're one in a googol: optimizing genes for protein expression", "pubMonth": "8", "journal": 2168, "abstract": "A vast number of different nucleic acid sequences can all be translated by the genetic code into the same amino acid sequence.

Attempts to transfer biomass-degrading capability to industrially useful organisms by heterologous expression of one or a few biomass-degrading enzymes have met with limited success. It seems probable that an effective biomass-degradation system requires the synergistic action of a large number of enzymes, the individual and collective actions of which are poorly understood. By offering the ability to combine any number of transgenes in a modular, combinatorial way, synthetic biology offers a new approach to elucidating the synergistic action of combinations of biomass-degrading enzymes in vivo and may ultimately lead to a transferable biomass-degradation system.

The methodology to computationally design a genome is based on an optimization that computationally mimics genome evolution. The biggest bottleneck lies on the use of an appropriatetness function. This fitness function, usually cell growth, relies on the ability to quantitatively model the biochemical networks of the cell at the genome scale using parameters inferred from high-throughput data. Computational methods integrating such models in a common multilayer design platform can be used to automatically engineer synthetic genomes under physiological specifications. We describe the current state-of-the-art on automated methods for engineering or re-engineering synthetic genomes.

The catabolism of dimethylglycine through methyl group oxidation can potentially liberate toxic formaldehyde, a problem common to many amine oxidases and dehydrogenases. Using a novel synthetic in vivo reporter system for cellular formaldehyde, we found that the oxidation of dimethylglycine is coupled to the synthesis of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate through an unusual substrate channeling mechanism. We also showed that uncoupling of the active sites could be achieved by mutagenesis or deletion of the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate synthase site and that this leads to accumulation of intracellular formaldehyde. Channeling occurs by non-biased diffusion of the labile intermediate through a large solvent cavity connecting both active sites. This central \"reaction chamber\" is created by a modular protein architecture that appears primitive when compared with the sophisticated design of other paradigm substrate-channeling enzymes.

Production of the repressor proteins is often limited due to inhibiting effects on the production host and requires iterative process optimization for each individual repressor. At the example of the Streptomyces pristinaespiralis-derived streptogramin-dependent repressor PIP, the expression of which was shown to inhibit growth of Escherichia coli BL21*, we demonstrate that the addition of the PIP-specific streptogramin antibiotic pristinamycin I neutralizes the growth-inhibiting effect and results in >100-fold increased PIP titers. The yield of PIP was further increased 2.5-fold by the engineering of a new E coli host suitable for the production of growth-inhibiting proteins encoded by an unfavorable codon usage. PIP produced in the presence of pristinamycin I was purified and was shown to retain the antibiotic-dependent binding to its operator pir as demonstrated by a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based approach. At the example of the macrolide, tetracycline- and arsenic-dependent repressors MphR(A), TetR and ArsR, we further demonstrate that the production yields can be increased 2- to 3-fold by the addition of the cognate inducer molecules erythromycin, tetracycline and As3+, respectively. Therefore, the addition of inducer molecules specific to the target repressor protein seems to be a general strategy to increase the yield of this interesting protein class. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

We design and implement compact, orthogonal gene expression networks. In particular we focus on creating transcription-translation feed-forward loops (FFLs). The transcription-translation FFLs reported cannot be created by using the cells' gene expression machinery and introduce information-processing delays on the order of hours into gene expression. We refactor the rRNA operon, uncoupling the synthesis of the orthogonal 16S rRNA for the O-ribosome from the synthesis and processing of the rest of the rRNA operon, thereby defining a minimal module that can be added to the cell for O-ribosome production. The minimal O-ribosome permits the rational alteration of the delay in an orthogonal gene expression FFL.

On the other hand, the levels of NADH, NAD(+), and NADH/NAD(+) were reduced whereas the levels of ATP and ADP were increased. These observations indicate that central carbon metabolism, levels of alcohol dehydrogenases, and the redox balance may be related to tolerance of ethanologenic yeast for and adaptation to furfural. Furthermore, proteins involved in stress response, including the unfolded protein response, oxidative stress, osmotic and salt stress, DNA damage and nutrient starvation, were differentially expressed, a finding that was validated by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR to further confirm that the general stress responses are essential for cellular defense against furfural.

The Gibbs free energies of formation and reaction are estimated for 914 compounds (81%) and 902 reactions (75%), respectively, in the database. The reactions are classified based on the minimum and maximum Gibbs free energy values, which accounts for uncertainty in the free energy estimates and a feasible concentration range relevant to biodegradation.

Reporter gene expression in the cascade without feedback showed a steep (sigmoidal) dose-response and a wide, nearly bimodal yEGFP distribution, giving rise to a noise peak at intermediate levels of induction. We developed computational models that reproduced the steep dose-response and the noise peak and predicted that negative autoregulation changes reporter expression from bimodal to unimodal and transforms the dose-response from sigmoidal to linear. Prompted by these predictions, we constructed a \"linearizer\" circuit by adding TetR autoregulation to our original cascade and observed a massive (7-fold) reduction of noise at intermediate induction and linearization of dose-response before saturation.

While many experimental methods exist for generating such specificity-altering mutations, few computational approaches are available, particularly in the case of bacterial transcription factors. In a previously published computational study of nitrogen oxide metabolism in bacteria, a small number of amino-acid residues were found to determine the specificity within the CRP (cAMP receptor protein)/FNR (fumarate and nitrate reductase regulatory protein) family of transcription factors. By analyzing how these amino acids vary in different regulators, a simple relationship between the identity of these residues and their target DNA-binding sequence was constructed.

This is the aim of the present work, in particular, we examined the question of the minimal physical size of cells using liposomes that entrapped the complete ribosomal machinery for expression of enhanced green fluorescence protein, and we made the assumption that this size would also correspond to a full fledged cell. We found that liposomes with a radius of about 100 nm, which is the smallest size ever considered in the literature for protein expression, are still capable of protein expression, and surprisingly, the average yield of fluorescent protein in the liposomes was 6.1-times higher than in bulk water. This factor would become even larger if one would refer only to the fraction of liposomes that are fully viable, which are those that contain all the molecular components (about 80). The observation of viable liposomes, which must contain all macromolecular components, indeed represents a conundrum. In fact, classic statistical analysis would give zero or negligible probability for the simultaneous entrapment of so many different molecular components in one single 100 nm radius spherical compartment at the given bulk concentration. The agreement between theoretical statistical predictions and experimental data is possible with the assumption that the concentration of solutes in the liposomes becomes larger by at least a factor twenty. Further investigation is required to understand the over-concentration mechanism, and to identify the several biophysical factors that could play a role in the observed activity enhancement.

The properties of three element interlocked positive feedback loops that embeds both mutual activation and inhibition are studied in depth for their bistable properties by performing bifurcation and stochastic simulations. Codimension one and two bifurcations reveal important properties like robustness to parameter variations and adaptability under various conditions by its ability to fine tune the threshold to a wide range of values and to maintain a wide bistable regime. Furthermore, we show that in the interlocked circuit, mutual inhibition controls the decision to switch from OFF to ON state, while mutual activation enforces the decision. This view is supported through a concrete biological example Candida albicans, a human fungal pathogen that can exist in two distinctive cell types: one in the default white state and the other in an opaque form. Stochastic switching between these two forms takes place due to the epigenetic alternation induced by the transcriptional regulators in the circuit, albeit without any rearrangement of the nuclear chromosomes. The transcriptional regulators constitute interlocked mutual activation and inhibition feedback circuits that provide adaptable threshold and wide bistable regime. These positive feedback loops are shown to be responsible for robust noise induced transitions without chattering, persistence of particular phenotypes for many generations and selective exhibition of one particular form of phenotype when Mutated. Finally, we propose for synthetic biology constructs to use interlocked positive feedback loops instead of two element positive feedback loops because they are better controlled than isolated mutual activation and mutual inhibition feedback circuits.

Following the design of naturally occurring three-way junctions we attached an additional helix (IV) to stem I of the HHR while maintaining very fast cleavage rates. We found that the cleavage activity strongly depends on the exact design of the junction site. Incorporation of the novel ribozyme scaffold into a bacterial mRNA allowed the control of gene expression mediated by autocatalytic cleavage of the ribozyme. Appending an aptamer to the newly introduced stem enabled the identification of very powerful theophylline-inducible RNA switches by in vivo screening.

Most of the currently available transgene control modalities have been designed to be responsive to clinically licensed pharmacologically active drugs which were expected to prevail in future clinical trials yet raised concerns about side effects when administered long term at subclinical doses. We have chosen vitamin H, also known as biotin, to control target gene transcription in mammalian cells in a potentially side effect-free manner. BirA, the Escherichia coli repressor of the biotin biosynthesis operon, was fused to the Herpes simplex transactivation domain to generate a biotin-dependent transactivator (BIT), which, in the presence of biotin, binds and activates chimeric target promoters (PBIT) harboring BirA-specific operator sites 50 of a minimal promoter.

Time delays are common and substantial in these biochemical processes due to gene transcription, translation, posttranslation protein modification and diffusion. Molecular noises in gene networks come from intrinsic fluctuations, transmitted noise from upstream genes, and the global noise affecting all genes. Knowledge of molecular noise filtering and biochemical process delay compensation in gene networks is crucial to understand the signal processing in gene networks and the design of noise-tolerant and delay-robust gene circuits for synthetic biology. Results: A nonlinear stochastic dynamic model with multiple time delays is proposed for describing a gene network under process delays, intrinsic molecular fluctuations, and extrinsic molecular noises. Then, the stochastic biochemical processing scheme of gene regulatory networks for attenuating these molecular noises and compensating process delays is investigated from the nonlinear signal processing perspective. In order to improve the robust stability for delay toleration and noise filtering, a robust gene circuit for nonlinear stochastic time-delay gene networks is engineered based on the nonlinear robust H-infinity stochastic filtering scheme. Further, in order to avoid solving these complicated noise-tolerant and delay-robust design problems, based on Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy time-delay model and linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) technique, a systematic gene circuit design method is proposed to simplify the design procedure. Conclusion: The proposed gene circuit design method has much potential for application to systems biology, synthetic biology and drug design when a gene regulatory network has to be designed for improving its robust stability and filtering ability of disease-perturbed gene network or when a synthetic gene network needs to perform robustly under process delays and molecular noises."}},{"pk": "5355", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "3", "pubYear": 2009, "doi": "10.1186/1752-0509-3-27", "sbw": 1, "title": "A framework for evolutionary systems biology", "pubMonth": "2", "journal": 976, "abstract": "Background: Many difficult problems in evolutionary genomics are related to mutations that have weak effects on fitness, as the consequences of mutations with large effects are often simple to predict. Current systems biology has accumulated much data on mutations with large effects and can predict the properties of knockout mutants in some systems. However experimental methods are too insensitive to observe small effects. Results: Here I propose a novel framework that brings together evolutionary theory and current systems biology approaches in order to quantify small effects of mutations and their epistatic interactions in silico. Central to this approach is the definition of fitness correlates that can be computed in some current systems biology models employing the rigorous algorithms that are at the core of much work in computational systems biology. The framework exploits synergies between the realism of such models and the need to understand real systems in evolutionary theory. This framework can address many longstanding topics in evolutionary biology by defining various 'levels' of the adaptive landscape. Addressed topics include the distribution of mutational effects on fitness, as well as the nature of advantageous mutations, epistasis and robustness. Combining corresponding parameter estimates with population genetics models raises the possibility of testing evolutionary hypotheses at a new level of realism. Conclusion: EvoSysBio is expected to lead to a more detailed understanding of the fundamental principles of life by combining knowledge about well-known biological systems from several disciplines. This will benefit both evolutionary theory and current systems biology.

In order to process this large amount of information, Systems Biology shows that a central role is played by regulatory networks composed of genes and proteins. The objective of this paper is to present and to discuss simple regulatory network motifs having the property to maximize their responses under time-periodic stimulations. In elucidating the mechanisms underlying these responses through simple networks the goal is to pinpoint general principles which optimize the oscillatory responses of molecular networks. Results: We took a look at basic network motifs studied in the literature such as the Incoherent Feedforward Loop (IFFL) or the interlerlocked negative feedback loop. The former is also generalized to a diamond pattern, with network components being either purely genetic or combining genetic and signaling pathways. Using standard mathematics and numerical simulations, we explain the types of responses exhibited by the IFFL with respect to a train of periodic pulses. We show that this system has a non-vanishing response only if the inter-pulse interval is above a threshold. A slight generalisation of the IFFL (the diamond) is shown to work as an ideal pass-band filter. We next show a mechanism by which average of oscillatory response can be maximized by bursting temporal patterns. Finally we study the interlerlocked negative feedback loop, i.e. a 2-gene motif forming a loop where the nodes respectively activate and repress each other, and show situations where this system possesses a resonance under periodic stimulation. Conclusion: We present several simple motif designs of molecular networks producing optimal output in response to periodic stimulations of the system. The identified mechanisms are simple and based on known network motifs in the literature, so that that they could be embodied in existing organisms, or easily implementable by means of synthetic biology.

Tomato fruit and its products contain the potent antioxidant lycopene and are the predominant source of lycopene in the human diet. In addition, tomato products are an important source of provitamin A (beta-carotene). The presence of other health promoting phytochemicals such as tocopherols and flavonoids in tomato has led to tomato and its products being termed a functional food. Over the past decade genetic/metabolic engineering of carotenoid biosynthesis and accumulation has resulted in the generation of transgenic varieties containing high lycopene and beta-carotene contents. In achieving this important goal many fundamental lessons have been learnt. Most notably is the observation that the endogenous carotenoid pathways in higher plants appear to resist engineered changes. Typically, this resistance manifests itself through intrinsic regulatory mechanisms that are \"silent\" until manipulation of the pathway is initiated. These mechanisms may include feedback inhibition, forward feed, metabolite channelling, and counteractive metabolic and cellular perturbations. In the present article we will review progress made in the genetic engineering of carotenoids in tomato fruit, highlighting the limiting regulatory mechanisms that have been observed experimentally.

One of the most ambitious research line concerns the so-called semi-synthetic minimal cells, which are liposome-based system capable of synthesizing the lipids within the liposome surface. This goal can be reached by reconstituting membrane proteins within liposomes and allow them to synthesize lipids. This approach, that can be defined as biochemical, was already reported by us (Schmidli et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 113, 8127-8130, 1991). In more advanced models, however, a full reconstruction of the biochemical pathway requires (1) the synthesis of functional membrane enzymes inside liposomes, and (2) the local synthesis of lipids as catalyzed by the in situ synthesized enzymes. Here we show the synthesis and the activity - inside liposomes - of two membrane proteins involved in phospholipids biosynthesis pathway. The proteins, sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) and lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase (LPAAT), have been synthesized by using a totally reconstructed cell-free system (PURE system) encapsulated in liposomes. The activities of internally synthesized GPAT and LPAAT were confirmed by detecting the produced lysophosphatidic acid and phosphatidic acid, respectively. Through this procedure, we have implemented the first phase of a design aimed at synthesizing phospholipid membrane from liposome within from within - which corresponds to the autopoietic growth mechanism.

It was postulated that even networks made up of small numbers of molecules possess a wealth of molecular information sufficient to perform rather complex behavior. To probe this assumption, we have constructed virtual arrays consisting of three replicating molecules, in which dimer templates are capable of catalyzing reactants to form additional templates.

Specifically, we have designed and implemented each of the three-element Boolean logic gates, and show how these networks are assembled from four basic \"building blocks\". We also show how the catalytic pathways can be wired together to perform more complex arithmetic units and network motifs, such as the half adder and half subtractor computational modules, and the coherent feed-forward loop network motifs under different sets of parameters.

To test the effect of membrane-membrane spacing on fusion, a series of conjugates was constructed by adding 2-24 noncomplementary bases at the membrane-proximal ends of two complementary sequences. Increasing linker lengths generally resulted in progressively reduced rates and extents of lipid and content mixing, in contrast to higher vesicle docking rates. The relatively flexible, single-stranded DNA linker facilitates docking but allows greater spacing between the vesicles after docking, thus making the transition into fusion less probable, but not preventing it altogether.

Capitalizing on a cross-kingdom-compatible expression platform, we pioneered a prototype biopharmaceutical manufacturing scenario using microencapsulated transgenic P. patens protoplasts cultivated in a Wave Bioreactor. Vascular endothelial growth factor 121 (VEGF(121)) titres matched those typically achieved by standard protonema populations grown in stirred-tank bioreactors. The full compatibility of mammalian expression systems in P. patens further promotes the use of moss as a cost-effective alternative for the manufacture of complex biopharmaceuticals, and as a valuable host system to advance synthetic biology in plants."}},{"pk": "6474", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "36", "pubYear": 2008, "doi": "10.1016/j.enpol.2008.09.034", "sbw": 0, "title": "Bioenergy for heat and electricity in the UK: A research atlas and roadmap", "pubMonth": "12", "journal": 6473, "abstract": "The UK has a significant biomass resource, estimated at an annual 20 million tonnes, but only a fraction of this is captured effectively for energy, contributing approximately 4.1% of the UK's heat and electricity production (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, 2007a.

Much biomass combustion technology may be considered as mature, although bottlenecks in the quality and quantity of feedstock are apparent, and further fundamental research is required to increase crop yield in a Sustainable manner, with low-chemical inputs to ensure efficient energy balance. In the short term, it could be useful for the UK to focus on developing a limited number of bioenergy chains, linked to combined heat and power microgeneration and the use of bioenergy for community and public sector projects. This should be linked to a joined-up policy and regulatory framework. A clear strategy for land management is also required, since many competing uses for land will emerge in the coming decades, including food production, nature conservation, carbon sequestration, urbanisation and other forms of renewable energy use. This finite resource must be managed effectively. In the long-term future, considerable excitement exists about the possibility of new bioscience technologies harnessed to improve photosynthetic gains for bioenergy, including the use of synthetic biology.

Moving beyond pure transcription networks, more and more networks are being implemented at the level of RNA, taking advantage of mechanisms of translational control and aptamer-small molecule complex formation.

Several fundamental gene circuits have been developed using this approach, including toggle switches(7) and oscillators(8-10), and these have been applied in new contexts such as triggered biofilm development(11) and cellular population control(12). Here we describe an engineered genetic oscillator in Escherichia coli that is fast, robust and persistent, with tunable oscillatory periods as fast as 13 min. The oscillator was designed using a previously modelled network architecture comprising linked positive and negative feedback loops(1,13). Using a microfluidic platform tailored for single- cell microscopy, we precisely control environmental conditions and monitor oscillations in individual cells through multiple cycles. Experiments reveal remarkable robustness and persistence of oscillations in the designed circuit, almost every cell exhibited large- amplitude fluorescence oscillations throughout observation runs. The oscillatory period can be tuned by altering inducer levels, temperature and the media source. Computational modelling demonstrates that the key design principle for constructing a robust oscillator is a time delay in the negative feedback loop, which can mechanistically arise from the cascade of cellular processes involved in forming a functional transcription factor. The positive feedback loop increases the robustness of the oscillations and allows for greater tunability. Examination of our refined model suggested the existence of a simplified oscillator design without positive feedback, and we construct an oscillator strain confirming this computational prediction."}},{"pk": "6681", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "9", "pubYear": 2008, "doi": "10.1002/cbic.200800340", "sbw": 1, "title": "Reconstitution and Anchoring of Cytoskeleton inside Giant Unilamellar Vesicles", "pubMonth": "11", "journal": 3187, "abstract": "Among the requirements for all life forms is the ability to self-replicate.

This made available a total of nine unique restriction sites for engineering. The DNA for donor \"reductive loops,\" which are sets of contiguous domains comprising either KR or KR and dehydratase (DH), or KR, DH and enoylreductase (ER) domains, was cloned from selected modules of five natural PKS multienzymes and spliced into module 2 of DEBS 1-TE using alternative polylinker sites. The resulting hybrid PKSs were tested for triketide production in vivo. Most of the hybrid multienzymes were active, vindicating the treatment of the reductive loop as a single structural unit, but yields were dependent on the restriction sites used. Further, different donor reductive loops worked optimally with different splice sites. For those reductive loops comprising DH, ER and KR domains, premature TE-catalysed release of partially reduced intermediates was sometimes seen, which provided further insight into the overall stereochemistry of reduction in those modules. Analysis of loops containing KR only, which should generate stereocentres at both C-2 and C-3, revealed that the 3-hydroxy configuration (but not the 2-methyl configuration) could be altered by appropriate choice of a donor loop.

All these strategies require prior identification of the phage and/or polysaccharide depolymerase capable of infecting the bacterial cells and degrading the polysaccharide within the biofilm, respectively. The biofilm organisms must therefore be isolated and screened against a bank of phages. This procedure is essential and raises important biotechnological challenges: the existence of a bank of phages well characterised (physiologically and genetically) whose efficacy in vivo has been tested and pharmacokinetics studied, the existence of economical and safe production protocols and purification methods (e.g. the presence of endotoxins in a phage preparation may compromise phage therapy). It is however important to consider the fact that the chances of getting a specific phage with a high lytic capability and preferential expressing a relevant exopolymer degrading enzyme is likely to be low. Genetically engineered phages can play an important role in this process. Phages can be genetically manipulated to alter their host range and to induce the production of depolymerases. It is therefore important to reinforce the application of synthetic biology to engineer phages able to efficiently degrade medical biofilms. It is also important to develop efficient methods of phage delivery and to study \"in vivo\" the phage performance against biofilms. It is still not clear how effective the biofilm can be in protecting the phages against the immune system. Efficient and economic phage production and purification protocols need also to be addressed before one can hope to use phage treatment to prevent or control infectious biofilms."}},{"pk": "7103", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "18", "pubYear": 2008, "doi": "10.1016/j.sbi.2008.06.006", "sbw": 11, "title": "Synthetic biology through biomolecular design and engineering", "pubMonth": "8", "journal": 7102, "abstract": "Synthetic biology is a rapidly growing field that has emerged in a global, multidisciplinary effort among biologists, chemists, engineers, physicists, and mathematicians.

Using this genetic selection, we created LuxI mutants with improved OHHL synthesis rates and yields through directed evolution, identifying three LuxI mutants after two generations. An in vivo semi-quantitative method allowed for verification of the genetic screen and OHHL yields were quantified using HPLC-MS/MS, revealing an 80-fold increase in a mutant culture compared to the wildtype culture. In addition to OHHL, the yields of C6HSL (hexanoyl homoserine lactone) and C8HSL (octanoyl homoserine lactone) were also improved, and a slight change in substrate specificity towards C6HSL production was observed. Based on alignment with the crystal structure of EsaI, a homolog of LuxI, two mutations are most likely involved in enhancing the interactions between the enzyme and the substrates. The high throughput genetic selection and the semi-quantitative method can be conveniently modified for the directed evolution of LuxI homologs. The identification of these LuxI mutants has implications in synthetic biology, where they can be used for the construction of artificial genetic circuits.

In both these cases, fluorescent proteins are commonly applied as a means of monitoring tire expression of genes in tire living cell, and efforts have been made to quantify protein expression levels through fluorescence intensity calibration and by monitoring the partitioning of proteins among the two daughter cells after division, such quantification is important in formulating the predictive models desired in systems and synthetic biology research. A potential pitfall of using plasmid-based gene expression systems is that the high protein levels associated with expression from plasmids can lead to the formation of inclusion bodies, insoluble aggregates of misfolded, nonfunctional proteins that will not generate fluorescence output, proteins caught in these inclusion bodies are thus \"dark\" to fluorescence-based detection methods. If significant numbers of proteins are incorporated into inclusion bodies rather than becoming biologically active, quantitative results obtained by fluorescent measurements will be skewed, we investigate this phenomenon here. We have created two plasmid constructs with differing average copy numbers, both incorporating air unregulated promoter (PLtetO-1 in tire absence of TetR) expressing the GFP derivative enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), and inserted them into Escherichia coli bacterial cells (a common model organism for work on the dynamics of prokaryotic gene expression). We extracted tire inclusion bodies, denatured them, and refolded them to reader them active, obtaining a measurement of the average number of EGFP per cell locked into these aggregates, at tire same time, we used calibrated fluorescent intensity measurements to determine the average number of active EGFP present per cell. Both measurements were carried out as a function of cellular doubling time, over a range of 45-75 min. We found that tire ratio of inclusion body EGFP to active EGFP varied strongly as a function of the cellular growth rate, and that the number of \"dark\" proteins in the aggregates could in fact be substantial, reaching ratios as high as approximately five proteins locked into inclusion bodies for every active protein (at the fastest growth rate), and dropping to ratios well below I (for the slowest growth rate).

At elevated temperatures, complex charged molecules such as nucleotides cross fatty-acid-based membranes very rapidly, suggesting that high temperature excursions may have facilitated nutrient uptake before the evolution of advanced membrane transporters.

Divide and Conquer (D&C), the quintessential recursive problem-solving technique, is applied in silico to divide the target DNA sequence into overlapping oligonucleotides short enough to be synthesized directly, albeit with errors, error-prone oligonucleotides are recursively combined in vitro, forming error-prone DNA molecules, error-free fragments of these molecules are then identified, extracted and used as new, typically longer and more accurate, inputs to another iteration of the recursive construction procedure, the entire process repeats until an error-free target molecule is formed. Our recursive construction procedure surpasses existing methods for de novo DNA synthesis in speed, precision, amenability to automation, ease of combining synthetic and natural DNA fragments, and ability to construct designer DNA libraries.

There are two main reasons why developing this hybrid discipline - synthetic morphology - would be useful. The first is that having a way to engineer self-constructing assemblies of cells would provide a powerful means of tissue engineering for clinical use in surgery and regenerative medicine. The second is that construction of simple novel systems according to theories of morphogenesis gained from study of real embryos will provide a means of testing those theories rigorously, something that is very difficult to do by manipulation of complex embryos. This paper sets out the engineering requirements for synthetic morphology, which include the development of a library of sensor modules, regulatory modules and effector modules that can be connected functionally within cells. A substantial number of sensor and regulatory modules already exist and this paper argues that some potential effector modules have already been identified.

We investigated the gene-to-protein relationship of firefly luciferase under the T7/E.Coli-extract expression system, as well as transcription-only reactions with T7 RNA polymerase, and found both systems to be highly sensitive to brush density, conformation, and orientation. A 'structure-function' picture emerges in which extension of genes induced by moderate packing exposes coding sequences and improves their interaction with the transcription/translation machinery. However, tighter packing impairs the penetration of the machinery into the brush. The response of expression to two-dimensional gene crowding at the nanoscale identifies gene brushes as basic controllable units en route to multicomponent synthetic systems. In turn, these brushes could deepen our understanding of biochemical reactions taking place under confinement and molecular crowding in living cells."}},{"pk": "7973", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "3", "pubYear": 2008, "doi": "", "sbw": 1, "title": "Computational modeling approaches for studying of synthetic biological networks", "pubMonth": "5", "journal": 7972, "abstract": "Synthetic biology is an emerging field that strives to build increasingly complex biological networks through the integration of molecular biology and engineering.

Using a synthetic biology approach involving the reconstruction of the putative electron transport chain of the DIR bacterium Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 in Escherichia coli, we showed that expression of cymA was necessary and sufficient to convert E. coli into a DIR bacterium. In intact cells, the Fe(III)-reducing activity was limited to Fe(III) NTA as electron acceptor. In vitro biochemical analysis indicated that CymA, which is a cytoplasmic membrane-associated tetrahaem c-type cytochrome, carries reductase activity towards Fe(III) NTA, Fe(III) citrate, as well as to AQDS, a humic acid analogue. The in vitro specific activities of Fe(III) citrate reductase and AQDS reductase of E. coli spheroplasts were 10x and 30x higher, respectively, relative to the specific rates observed in intact cells, suggesting that access of chelated and insoluble forms of Fe(III) and AQDS is restricted in whole cells. Interestingly, the E. coli CymA orthologue NapC also carried ferric reductase activity. Our data support the argument that the biochemical mechanism of Fe(III) reduction per se was not the key innovation leading to environmental relevant DIR bacteria. Rather, the evolution of an extension of the electron transfer pathway from the Fe(III) reductase CymA to the cell surface via a system of periplasmic and outer membrane cytochrome proteins enabled access to diffusion-impaired electron acceptors."}},{"pk": "8177", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "56", "pubYear": 2008, "doi": "", "sbw": 0, "title": "Biochemistry and molecular biology 2007", "pubMonth": "3", "journal": 8176, "abstract": ""}},{"pk": "8182", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "77", "pubYear": 2008, "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevE.77.021908", "sbw": 0, "title": "Effects of protein maturation on the noise in gene expression", "pubMonth": "2", "journal": 3779, "abstract": "Fluorescent proteins are frequently used as reporters for gene expression in living cells, either by being expressed in tandem with a protein of interest or through the creation of fusion proteins. The data yielded by the fluorescence output are of considerable interest in efforts to formulate quantitative models of cellular behavior underway in fields such as systems biology and synthetic biology. An often neglected aspect of these proteins, however, is their maturation: Before a fluorescent protein can generate a fluorescent signal, it must mature through a series of steps (folding, cyclization, and oxidation) that may take from many minutes to over a day. The presence of these maturation steps creates a distinction between the observed gene expression profile and the actual profile. We examine this effect through a simplified gene expression model and conclude that fluorescent protein maturation can have significant effects on estimates of both the mean protein levels and the variability in gene expression. The model shows that in many regimes, the observed variability will be increased by the maturation process, but indicates the existence of regimes in which the observed variability will actually be less than the true variability of the target protein. The latter effect arises from a low-pass filtering effect introduced by the chain of maturation reactions.

Secondly, it does not cover natural product and semisynthetic natural product drugs, which constitute over one-third of all marketed small-molecule drugs. A more balanced and programmatic approach to drug discovery should be more productive than to rely on an overemphasis of 'rule-of-five' compliance. Rather it should consider proactively the development of parenteral drugs in parallel to oral drugs and to consider the development of therapeutic antibodies in parallel to small-molecule drugs.

Genetic networks are intrinsically noisy due to natural random intra- and inter-cellular fluctuations.

From the synthetic biology viewpoint, it is also important to implement biological systems that minimizing the negative influence of the perturbations. Results: In this paper, based on systems biology approach, we provide a general theoretical result on the synchronization of genetic oscillators with stochastic perturbations. By exploiting the specific properties of many genetic oscillator models, we provide an easy-verified sufficient condition for the stochastic synchronization of coupled genetic oscillators, based on the Lur'e system approach in control theory. A design principle for minimizing the influence of noise is also presented. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results, a population of coupled repressillators is adopted as a numerical example.

The most widely used heterologous gene regulation systems are responsive to antibiotics of the tetracycline, streptogramin and macrolide classes. Although these antibiotics are clinically licensed, concerns about the emergence of resistant bacteria, side-effects in animal studies, and economic considerations associated with clearance of antibiotics in biopharmaceutical manufacturing, have limited the use of heterologous transgene control modalities to basic research activities. We have therefore designed a strategy to convert antibiotic-responsive transcription factors into gene regulation systems responsive to non-toxic biotin, also known as vitamin H. Constitutive ligation of biotin to the Avitag-containing VP16 transactivation domain by the Escherichia coli biotin ligase BirA enables heterodimerization with tetracycline- (TetR), streptogramin- (Pip), and macrolide- (E) dependent repressors fused to streptavidin, which creates synthetic transactivators able to activate specific promoters (PhCMV*-1, P-PIR, P-ETR). We have demonstrated (i) that exogenous biotin (40 nM) can induce heterologous transgene expression in a biotin- (serum-) free culture environment (biotin-dependent heterodimerization of transactivator), (ii) that excess biotin (above 200 mu m) gradually represses transgene expression in a biotin- (serum-) containing environment (saturation of streptavidin by excess biotin prevents heterodimerization of the transactivator), and (iii) that avidin can sequestrate endogenous biotin in serum-containing cultures and so repress transgene expression in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, by engineering all off the components required for biotin-controlled transgene expression (Avitag-VP16, repressor-streptavidin, BirA) into a tricistronic (lenti)vector configuration, it was possible to transfect (transduce) a variety of mammalian cell lines and primary cells and enable biotin-controlled transgene expression in a simple and straightforward manner.

In the engineered system, the peptides assemble into two-stranded a-helical coiled-coil rods, which pack in axial register in a 3D hexagonal lattice of size 1.824 nm, and with a periodicity of 4.2 nm along the fiber axis. This model is supported by both electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction. Specifically, the fibers display surface striations separated by nanoscale distances that precisely match the 4.2-nm length expected for peptides configured as a-helices as designed. These patterns extend unbroken across the widths (>= 50 nm) and lengths (> 10 mu m) of the fibers. Furthermore, the spacing of the striations can be altered predictably by changing the length of the peptides.

The past 5 years has thus seen the design and construction of the first synthetic mammalian gene regulatory networks. These networks have built upon pioneering advances in prokaryotic synthetic networks and possess an impressive range of functionalities that will some day enable the engineering of sophisticated inter- and intra-cellular functions to become a reality. At a relatively simple level, the modular linking of transcriptional components has enabled the creation of genetic networks that are strongly analogous to the architectural design and functionality of electronic circuits. Thus, by combining components in different serial or parallel configurations it is possible to produce networks that follow strict logic in integrating multiple independent signals (logic gates and transcriptional cascades) or which temporally modify input signals (time-delay circuits). Progressing in terms of sophistication, synthetic transcriptional networks have also been constructed which emulate naturally occurring genetic properties, such as bistability or dynamic instability. Toggle switches which possess \"memory\" so as to remember transient administered inputs, hysteric switches which are resistant to stochastic fluctuations in inputs, and oscillatory networks which produce regularly timed expression outputs, are all examples of networks that have been constructed using such properties. Initial steps have also been made in designing the above networks to respond not only to exogenous signals, but also endogenous signals that may be associated with aberrant cellular function or physiology thereby providing a means for tightly controlled gene therapy applications. Moving beyond pure transcriptional control, synthetic networks have also been created which utilize phenomena, such as post-transcriptional silencing, translational control, or inter-cellular signaling to produce novel network-based control both within and between cells. It is envisaged in the not-too-distant future that these networks will provide the basis for highly sophisticated genetic manipulations in biopharmaceutical manufacturing, gene therapy and tissue engineering applications.

Three examples of this 'chemical synthetic biology' approach are given in this article. The first example deals with the synthesis of proteins that do not exist in nature, and dubbed as 'the never born proteins' (NBPs). This research is related to the question why and how the protein structures existing in our world have been selected out, with the underlying question whether they have something very particular from the structural or thermodynamic point of view (for example, the folding). The NBPs are produced in the laboratory by the modern molecular biology technique, the phage display, so as to produce a very large library of proteins having no homology with known proteins. The second example of chemical synthetic biology has also to do with the laboratory synthesis of proteins, but, this time, adopting a prebiotic synthetic procedure, the fragment condensation of short peptides, where short means that they have a length that can be obtained by prebiotic methods for example, from the condensation of N-carboxy anhydrides. The scheme is illustrated and discussed, being based on the fragment condensation catalyzed by peptides endowed with proteolitic activity. Selection during chain growth is determined by solubility under the contingent environmental conditions, i.e., the peptides which result insoluble are eliminated from further growth. The scheme is tested preliminarily with a synthetic chemical fragment-condensation method and brings to the synthesis of a 44-residueslong protein, which has no homology with known proteins, and which has a stable tertiary folding. Finally, the third example, dubbed as 'the minimal cell project'. Here, the aim is to synthesize a cell model having the minimal and sufficient number of components to be defined as living. For this purpose, liposomes are used as shell membranes, and attempts are made to introduce in the interior a minimal genome. Several groups all around the world are active in this field, and significant results have been obtained, which are reviewed in this article. For example, protein expression has been obtained inside liposomes, generally with the green fluorescent protein, GFP Our last attempts are with a minimal genome consisting of 37 enzymes, a set which is able to express proteins using the ribosomal machinery. These minimal cells are not yet capable of self-reproduction, and this and other shortcomings within the project are critically reviewed."}},{"pk": "9440", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "447", "pubYear": 2007, "doi": "10.1038/nature05851", "sbw": 16, "title": "Rewiring cellular morphology pathways with synthetic guanine nucleotide exchange factors", "pubMonth": "5", "journal": 2324, "abstract": "Eukaryotic cells mobilize the actin cytoskeleton to generate a remarkable diversity of morphological behaviours, including motility, phagocytosis and cytokinesis. Much of this diversity is mediated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs) that activate Rho family GTPases - the master regulators of the actin cytoskeleton(1-3). There are over 80 Rho GEFs in the human genome ( compared to only 22 genes for the Rho GTPases themselves), and the evolution of new and diverse GEFs is thought to provide a mechanism for linking the core cytoskeletal machinery to a wide range of new control inputs. Here we test this hypothesis and ask if we can systematically reprogramme cellular morphology by engineering synthetic GEF proteins. We focused on Dbl family Rho GEFs, which have a highly modular structure common to many signalling proteins(4,5): they contain a catalytic Dbl homology (DH) domain linked to diverse regulatory domains, many of which autoinhibit GEF activity(2,3). Here we show that by recombining catalytic GEF domains with new regulatory modules, we can generate synthetic GEFs that are activated by non-native inputs. We have used these synthetic GEFs to reprogramme cellular behaviour in diverse ways. The GEFs can be used to link specific cytoskeletal responses to normally unrelated upstream signalling pathways. In addition, multiple synthetic GEFs can be linked as components in series to form an artificial cascade with improved signal processing behaviour. These results show the high degree of evolutionary plasticity of this important family of modular signalling proteins, and indicate that it may be possible to use synthetic biology approaches to manipulate the complex spatio-temporal control of cell morphology."}},{"pk": "9450", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "5", "pubYear": 2007, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pbio.0050058", "sbw": 2, "title": "Synthetic biology: Caught between property rights, the public domain, and the commons", "pubMonth": "3", "journal": 9449, "abstract": ""}},{"pk": "9457", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "7", "pubYear": 2007, "doi": "10.1186/1472-6750-7-16", "sbw": 1, "title": "Engineering proteinase K using machine learning and synthetic genes", "pubMonth": "3", "journal": 9456, "abstract": "Background: Altering a protein's function by changing its sequence allows natural proteins to be converted into useful molecular tools. Current protein engineering methods are limited by a lack of high throughput physical or computational tests that can accurately predict protein activity under conditions relevant to its final application. Here we describe a new synthetic biology approach to protein engineering that avoids these limitations by combining high throughput gene synthesis with machine learning-based design algorithms. Results: We selected 24 amino acid substitutions to make in proteinase K from alignments of homologous sequences. We then designed and synthesized 59 specific proteinase K variants containing different combinations of the selected substitutions. The 59 variants were tested for their ability to hydrolyze a tetrapeptide substrate after the enzyme was first heated to 68 C for 5 minutes. Sequence and activity data was analyzed using machine learning algorithms. This analysis was used to design a new set of variants predicted to have increased activity over the training set, that were then synthesized and tested. By performing two cycles of machine learning analysis and variant design we obtained 20-fold improved proteinase K variants while only testing a total of 95 variant enzymes. Conclusion: The number of protein variants that must be tested to obtain significant functional improvements determines the type of tests that can be performed. Protein engineers wishing to modify the property of a protein to shrink tumours or catalyze chemical reactions under industrial conditions have until now been forced to accept high throughput surrogate screens to measure protein properties that they hope will correlate with the functionalities that they intend to modify. By reducing the number of variants that must be tested to fewer than 100, machine learning algorithms make it possible to use more complex and expensive tests so that only protein properties that are directly relevant to the desired application need to be measured. Protein design algorithms that only require the testing of a small number of variants represent a significant step towards a generic, resource-optimized protein engineering process."}},{"pk": "9470", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "7", "pubYear": 2007, "doi": "10.1002/pmic.200600442", "sbw": 3, "title": "The extant core bacterial proteorne is an archive of the origin of life", "pubMonth": "3", "journal": 9469, "abstract": "Genes consistently present in a clique of genomes, preferring the leading DNA strands are deemed persistent.

Removal of biotin from the culture environment (input signal 3) results in time-delayed transgene expression until the intracellular biotinylated VP16 pool is degraded. Because the TetR component of the chimeric transactivator retains its tetracycline responsiveness, addition of this antibiotic (input signal 4) overrides biotin control and immediately shuts off target gene expression. Biotin-responsive immediate, bandpass filter, and time-delay transcription characteristics were predicted by a computational model and have been validated in standard cultivation settings or biopharmaceutical manufacturing scenarios using trangenic CHO-K1 cell derivatives and have been confirmed in mice.

Such diversity makes the ability to create and control cooperation desirable for potential applications in areas as varied as agriculture, pollutant treatment, and medicine. Here we show that persistent cooperation can be engineered by introducing a small set of genetic modifications into previously noninteracting cell populations. Specifically, we report the construction of a synthetic obligatory cooperative system, termed CoSMO (cooperation that is synthetic and mutually obligatory), which consists of a pair of nonmating yeast strains, each supplying an essential metabolite to the other strain. The behavior of the two strains in isolation, however, revealed unintended constraints that restrict cooperation, such as asymmetry in starvation tolerance and delays in nutrient release until near cell death. However, the joint system is shown mathematically and experimentally to be viable over a wide range of initial conditions, with oscillating population ratio settling to a value predicted by nutrient supply and consumption. Unexpectedly, even in the absence of explicitly engineered mechanisms to stabilize cooperation, the cooperative system can consistently develop increased ability to survive reductions in population density. Extending synthetic biology from the design of genetic circuits to the engineering of ecological interactions, CoSMO provides a quantitative system for linking processes at the cellular level to the collective behavior at the system level, as well as a genetically tractable system for studying the evolution of cooperation."}},{"pk": "9708", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "21", "pubYear": 2007, "doi": "10.1101/gad.1507207", "sbw": 29, "title": "Designing biological systems", "pubMonth": "2", "journal": 7297, "abstract": "The design of artificial biological systems and the understanding of their natural counterparts are key objectives of the emerging discipline of synthetic biology.

SARS-CoV is a zoonotic virus that crossed the species barrier, most likely originating from bats or from other species including civets, raccoon dogs, domestic cats, swine, and rodents. A SARS-CoV vaccine should confer long-term protection, especially in vulnerable senescent populations, against both the 2003 epidemic strains and zoonotic strains that may yet emerge from animal reservoirs. We report the comprehensive investigation of SARS vaccine efficacy in young and senescent mice following homologous and heterologous challenge. Methods and Findings Using Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles (VRP) expressing the 2003 epidemic Urbani SARS-CoV strain spike (S) glycoprotein (VRP-S) or the nucleocapsid (N) protein from the same strain (VRP-N), we demonstrate that VRP-S, but not VRP-N vaccines provide complete short-and long-term protection against homologous strain challenge in young and senescent mice. To test VRP vaccine efficacy against a heterologous SARS-CoV, we used phylogenetic analyses, synthetic biology, and reverse genetics to construct a chimeric virus (icGDO3-S) encoding a synthetic S glycoprotein gene of the most genetically divergent human strain, GDO3, which clusters among the zoonotic SARS-CoV. icGD03-S replicated efficiently in human airway epithelial cells and in the lungs of young and senescent mice, and was highly resistant to neutralization with antisera directed against the Urbani strain. Although VRP-S vaccines provided complete short-term protection against heterologous icGD03-S challenge in young mice, only limited protection was seen in vaccinated senescent animals. VRP-N vaccines not only failed to protect from homologous or heterologous challenge, but resulted in enhanced immunopathology with eosinophilic infiltrates within the lungs of SARS-CoV challenged mice. VRP-N-induced pathology presented at day 4, peaked around day 7, and persisted through day 14, and was likely mediated by cellular immune responses. Conclusions This study identifies gaps and challenges in vaccine design for controlling future SARS-CoV zoonosis, especially in vulnerable elderly populations. The availability of a SARS-CoV virus bearing heterologous S glycoproteins provides a robust challenge inoculum for evaluating vaccine efficacy against zoonotic strains, the most likely source of future outbreaks."}},{"pk": "9774", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "29", "pubYear": 2006, "doi": "", "sbw": 0, "title": "Zinc finger proteins: An overview", "pubMonth": "0", "journal": 9773, "abstract": "Zinc finger domains are the most common DNA-binding transcription factors in which zinc (II) contributes to the structural stability of the domain.

This control strategy was theoretically shown to be superior to an equivalent but nonautogenously regulated system when based on a repressor. Although some of its advantages were later confirmed with isolated synthetic circuits, the superiority of autogenous control in natural networks remains untested. Here, we use the SOS DNA repair system of Escherichia coli, where autogenous control is part of a single-input module, as a valid model to evaluate the functional advantages and biological implications of this mechanism. We redesign the control of its master regulator, the protein LexA, so that it becomes nonautogenously controlled. We compare both systems by combining high-resolution expression measurements with mathematical modeling. We show that the stronger stability associated with the autogenous regulation prevents false triggering of the response due to transient fluctuations in the inducing signal and that this control also reduces the system recovery time at low DNA damage. Likewise, autoregulation produces responses proportional to the damage signal level. In contrast, bacteria with LexA constitutively expressed induce maximal action even for very low damage levels. This excess in response comes at a cost, because it reduces comparatively the growth rate of these cells. Our results suggest that autogenous control evolved as a strategy to optimally respond to multiple levels of input signal minimizing the costs of the response and highlights reasons why master regulators of single-input modules are mostly autorepressed."}},{"pk": "10119", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "36", "pubYear": 2006, "doi": "", "sbw": 0, "title": "Catholic critics of early synthetic biology experiments: Agostini Gemelli, Jaume Pujiula and Jean Maumus", "pubMonth": "6", "journal": 9718, "abstract": ""}},{"pk": "10125", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "24", "pubYear": 2006, "doi": "10.1038/nbt1226", "sbw": 30, "title": "Combinatorial engineering of intergenic regions in operons tunes expression of multiple genes", "pubMonth": "8", "journal": 912, "abstract": "Many applications of synthetic biology require the balanced expression of multiple genes.

This interplay involves iterative cycles, such that systems biology is not at all confined to hypothesis-dependent studies, with intelligent, principled, hypothesis-generating studies being of high importance and consequently very far from aimless fishing expeditions. I seek to illustrate each of these facets. Novel technology development in metabolomics can increase substantially the dynamic range and number of metabolites that one can detect, and these can be exploited as disease markers and in the consequent and principled generation of hypotheses that are consistent with the data and achieve this in a value-free manner. Much of classical biochemistry and signalling pathway analysis has concentrated on the analyses of changes in the concentrations of intermediates, with 'local' equations - such as that of Michaelis and Menten v=((VmaxS)-S-.)/(S+K-m) - that describe individual steps being based solely on the instantaneous values of these concentrations. Recent work using single cells (that are not subject to the intellectually unsupportable averaging of the variable displayed by heterogeneous cells possessing nonlinear kinetics) has led to the recognition that some protein signalling pathways may encode their signals not (just) as concentrations (AM or amplitude-modulated in a radio analogy) but via changes in the dynamics of those concentrations (the signals are FM or frequency-modulated). This contributes in principle to a straightforward solution of the crosstalk problem, leads to a profound reassessment of how to understand the downstream effects of dynamic changes in the concentrations of elements in these pathways, and stresses the role of signal processing (and not merely the intermediates) in biological signalling. It is this signal processing that lies at the heart of understanding the languages of cells. The resolution of many of the modern and postgenomic problems of biochemistry requires the development of a myriad of new technologies (and maybe a new culture), and thus regular input from the physical sciences, engineering, mathematics and computer science. One solution, that we are adopting in the Manchester Interdisciplinary Biocentre (http://www.mib.ac.uk/) and the Manchester Centre for Integrative Systems Biology (http://www.mcisb.org/), is thus to colocate individuals with the necessary combinations of skills.

Reported here is a solution to this problem. The solution replaces thymidine triphosphate by 2-thiothymidine triphosphate (2-thioTTP). Because of the bulk and hydrogen bonding properties of the thione unit in 2-thioT, 2-thioT does not mispair effectively with the minor tautomer of isoG. To test whether this might allow PCR amplification of a six-letter artificially expanded genetic information system, we examined the relative rates of misincorporation of 2-thioTTP and TTP opposite isoG using affinity electrophoresis. The concentrations of isoCTP and 2-thioTTP were optimal to best support PCR amplification using thermostable polymerases of a six-letter alphabet that includes the isoC-isoG pair.

While synthetic biology was until recently restricted to network assembly and testing in prokaryotes, decisive advances have been achieved in eukaryotic systems based on current availability of different human-compatible transgene control technologies. Most prominent examples include the epigenetic gene network enabling metastable fully inheritable transgene expression states in mice, artificial regulatory cascades managing multi-level expression control and Boolean-type BioLogic gates supporting near-digital expression readout. The majority of transgene control networks available to date are fully synthetic and integrate artificial extracellular signals in a desired host metabolism-independent manner. Yet, in order to develop their full anticipated therapeutic potential, synthetic transgene control circuits need to be well interconnected with the host cell's regulatory networks in order to enable physiologic control of prosthetic molecular expression units. We have designed three semi-synthetic transcription control networks able to integrate physiologic oxygen levels and artificial antibiotic signals to produce expression readout with NOT IF or NOR-type Boolean logic or discrete multi-level control of several intracellular and secreted model product proteins. Subtle differences in the regulation performance of the endogenous oxygen-sensing system in CHO-K1 and human HT-1080 switched the semi-synthetic network's readout from a classic four-level (high, medium, low, basal) regulatory cascade to a network enabling six discrete transgene expression levels. These findings are in excellent correspondence with a mathematical model. Prosthetic networks, precisely embedded in host regulatory networks and co-fine-tuned by physiologic as well as pharmacologic input signals, will foster future advances in gene therapy and tissue engineering.

We further demonstrate that the noise required to produce these distinct properties can itself be caused by a set of auxiliary chemical reactions, making it feasible for biological systems of sufficient complexity to generate such behavior internally. This new stochastic dynamics then serves to confer additional functional modalities on the enzymatic futile cycle mechanism that include stochastic amplification and signaling, the characteristics of which could be controlled by both the type and parameters of the driving noise. Hence, such noise-induced phenomena may, among other roles, potentially offer a novel type of control mechanism in pathways that contain these cycles and the like units.

The receiver cells contain a pulse-generator circuit that incorporates a feed-forward regulatory motif. The circuit responds to a long-lasting increase in the level of AHL by transiently activating, and then repressing, the expression of a GFP.

These drugs bind at a site near, but not in, the active site. This variant accepts the pyDAD-puADA base pair significantly better than wild type HIV-RT, and we used this as a starting point. A second mutation, E478Q, was introduced into the Y188L variant, in the event that the residual nuclease activity observed is due to the RT, and not a contaminant.

In addition, we present detailed data in relation to minimal genome, with observations cited by several authors who agree on setting the theoretical full-fledged minimal genome to a figure between 200 and 300 genes. However, further theoretical assumptions may significantly reduce this number (i.e. by eliminating ribosomal proteins and by limiting DNA and RNA polymerases to only a few, less specific molecular species). Generally, the experimental approach to minimal cells consists in utilizing liposomes as cell models and in filling them with genes/enzymes corresponding to minimal cellular functions. To date, a few research groups have successfully induced the expression of single proteins, such as the green fluorescence protein, inside liposomes. Here, different approaches are described and compared. Present constructs are still rather far from the minimal cell, and experimental as well as theoretical difficulties opposing further reduction of complexity are discussed.

The available data from several systematic experimental approaches to define all the essential genes in some completely sequenced bacterial genomes were also considered, and a reconstruction of a minimal metabolic machinery necessary to sustain life was carried out. The proposed minimal genome contains 206 protein-coding genes with all the genetic information necessary for self-maintenance and reproduction in the presence of a full complement of essential nutrients and in the absence of environmental stress. The main features of such a minimal gene set, as well as the metabolic functions that must be present in the hypothetical minimal cell, are discussed."}},{"pk": "11451", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "87", "pubYear": 2004, "doi": "10.1002/bit.20142", "sbw": 18, "title": "BioLogic gates enable logical transcription control in mammalian cells", "pubMonth": "8", "journal": 1750, "abstract": "The architecture of gene regulatory networks is reminiscent of electronic circuits.

However, due to the lack of a critical amount of eukaryotic cell-compatible gene regulation systems, the field has so far been limited to prokaryotes. Recent development of several mammalian cell-compatible expression control systems laid the foundations for the assembly of transcription control modules that can respond to several inputs.

Here, we overcome these difficulties by using a simple synthetic microbial system of producers and nonproducers of an extracellular growth-enhancing molecule, which acts as a 'common good.'

In this paper, multistability of GRNs is analyzed by applying the control theory and mathematical tools. This study is to provide a theoretical tool to facilitate the design of synthetic gene circuit with multistability in the perspective of control theory. By transforming such GRNs into a new and uniform mathematical formulation, we put forward a general sector-like regulation function that is capable of quantifying the regulation effects in a more precise way.

New conditions are then proposed to ensure the multistability of a GRN in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) that are dependent on the delays. Our multistability conditions are applicable to several frequently used regulation functions especially the multivariable ones.

In this paper, we report the photooxidative coupling of thiophenol derivatives to disulfides. Para-substituted thiophenol derivatives, p-SHC6H4X (X = NO2, COOH, Cl, and OCH3), are irradiated, and disulfides, X-7(C6H4)(2)S-2, are identified as the major photoproducts using Raman, UV vis, IR, and NMR spectroscopies. For p-nitrothiophenol (pNTP), 4,4'-dinitrodiphenyldisulfide (DNDPDS) is produced in 81% yield. The product yield changes with pH, being the highest at pH 5, suggesting that both neutral thiol and anionic thiolate forms of pNTP are required for the photoreaction to occur. Excitation at 455 nm, at which the thiolate form of pNTP absorbs strongly, leads to the largest yield of DNDPDS, whereas very little DNDPDS is formed by excitation of the thiol form of pNTP at 325 nm. Our observations suggest that the photooxidation occurs via collisions of the electronically excited thiolate form of pNTP with the surrounding neutral thiol forms of pNTP. The photooxidation reaction happens regardless of the electron-withdrawing or electron-donating properties of the substituents if the and excitation wavelengths are properly chosen. The versatility of light and generality of the photooxidative coupling reaction of thiophenol derivatives may open new possibilities for selective and site-specific photocontrol of disulfide bond formation in biology and nanomaterial science as well as in synthetic chemistry."}},{"pk": "12353", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "105", "pubYear": 2010, "doi": "10.1016/j.jip.2010.06.011", "sbw": 0, "title": "Characterization of an extracellular lipase from the biocontrol fungus, Nomuraea rileyi MJ, and its toxicity toward Spodoptera litura", "pubMonth": "11", "journal": 12352, "abstract": "An extracellular lipase from Nomuraea rileyi MJ was purified 23.9-fold with 1.69% yield by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by Sephacryl S-100 HR column chromatography.

Hence, stem cell culture parameters are critical and need to be continuously refined according to progress in our stem cell biology understanding and the latest technological developments. In the past few years, major efforts have been made to define more precisely the medium composition in which stem cells grow or differentiate. This led to the progressive replacement of ill-defined additives such as serum or feeder cell layers by recombinant cytokines or growth factors. Another example is the control of the oxygen pressure. For many years cell cultures have been done under atmospheric oxygen pressure which is much higher than the one experienced by stem cells in vivo. A consequence of cell metabolism is that cell culture conditions are constantly changing. Therefore, the development of high sensitive monitoring processes anti control algorithms is required for ensuring cell culture medium homeostasis. Stem cells also sense the physical constraints of their microenvironment. Rigidity, stiffness, and geometry of the culture substrate influence stem cell :rate.

Gravimetric density of polysaccharides is 14.8 H-2 mass% where water can be recycled from PEM fuel cells or 8.33% H-2 mass% without water recycling, volumetric densities of polysaccharides are >100 kg of H-2/m(3). Renewable carbohydrates (e.g., cellulosic materials and starch) are less expensive based on GJ than are other hydrogen carriers, such as hydrocarbons, biodiesel, methanol, ethanol, and ammonia. Biotransformation of carbohydrates to hydrogen by cell-free synthetic (enzymatic) pathway biotransformation (SyPaB) has numerous advantages, such as high product yield (12 H-2/glucose unit), 100% selectivity, high energy conversion efficiency (122%, based on combustion energy), high-purity hydrogen generated, mild reaction conditions, low-cost of bioreactor, few safety concerns, and nearly no toxicity hazards. Although SyPaB may suffer from current low reaction rates, numerous approaches for accelerating hydrogen production rates are proposed and discussed. Potential applications of carbohydrate-based hydrogen/electricity generation would include hydrogen bioreactors, home-size electricity generators, sugar batteries for portable electronics, sugar-powered passenger vehicles, and so on. Developments in thermostable enzymes as standardized building blocks for cell-free SyPaB projects, use of stable and low-cost biomimetic NAD cofactors, and accelerating reaction rates are among the top research & development priorities.

The secreted cellulases were docked onto the displayed Scaf-ctf in a highly organized manner based on the specific interaction of the three cohesin-dockerin pairs employed, resulting in the assembly of a functional minicellulosome on the yeast surface. By exploiting the modular nature of each population to provide a unique building block for the minicellulosome structure, the overall cellulosome assembly, cellulose hydrolysis, and ethanol production were easily fine-tuned by adjusting the ratio of different populations in the consortium. The optimized consortium consisted of a SC: AT: CB: BF ratio of 7:2:4:2 and produced almost twice the level of ethanol (1.87 g/liter) as a consortium with an equal ratio of the different populations.

A cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, is a mimetic agonist of these metabolites. Crystallographic analyses revealed that an indole acetate functions as a common moiety for the recognition by the sub-pocket near helix H12. Intriguingly, a serotonin metabolite and a fatty-acid metabolite each bind to distinct sub-pockets, and the PPAR gamma antagonist, T0070907, blocked the fatty-acid agonism, but not that of the serotonin metabolites. Mutational analyses on receptor-mediated transcription and coactivator binding revealed that each metabolite individually uses coregulator and/or heterodimer interfaces in a ligand-type-specific manner.

Recently, developmental biology has been infused by evolutionary concepts and perspectives, and a new field of research-evolutionary developmental biology-has been created and is often called EvoDevo for short. However, this is not the first attempt to make a synthesis between these two areas of biology. In contrast, beginning right after the publication of Darwin's Origin in 1859, Ernst Haeckel formulated his biogenetic law in 1872, famously stating that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny. Haeckel was in his turn influenced by pre-Darwinian thinkers such as Karl Ernst von Baer, who had noted that earlier developmental stages show similarities not seen in the adults. In this review, written for an audience of non-specialists, we first give an overview of the history of EvoDevo, especially the tradition emanating from Haeckel and other comparative embryologists and morphologists, which has often been neglected in discussions about the history of EvoDevo and evolutionary biology. Here we emphasize contributions from Russian and German scientists to compensate for the Anglo-American bias in the literature. In Germany, the direct influence of Ernst Haeckel was felt particularly in Jena, where he spent his entire career as a professor, and we give an overview of the \"Jena school\" of evolutionary morphology, with protagonists such as Oscar Hertwig, Ludwig Plate, and Victor Franz, who all developed ideas that we would nowadays think of as belonging to EvoDevo. Franz ideas about \"biometabolic modi\" are similar to those of a Russian comparative morphologist that visited Jena repeatedly, A. N. Sewertzoff, who made important contributions to what we now call heterochrony research-heterochrony meaning changes in the relative timing of developmental events. His student I. I. Schmalhausen became an important contributor to the synthetic theory of evolution in Russia and is only partly known outside of the Russian-reading world because only one of his many books was translated into English early on. He made many important contributions to evolutionary theory and we point out the important parallels between Schmalhausen's ideas (stabilizing selection, autonomization) and C. H. Waddington's (canalization, genetic assimilation). This is one of the many parallels that have contributed to an increased appreciation of the internationality of progress in evolutionary thinking in the first half of the twentieth century. A direct link between German and Russian evolutionary biology is provided by N. V. Timof,eff-Ressovsky, whose work on, e.g., fly genetics in Berlin is a crucial part of the history of evo-devo. To emphasize the international nature of heterochrony research as predecessor to the modern era of EvoDevo, we include Sir G. R. de Beer's work in the UK. This historical part is followed by a short review of the discovery and importance of homeobox genes and of some of the major concepts that form the core of modern EvoDevo, such as modularity, constraints, and evolutionary novelties. Major trends in contemporary EvoDevo are then outlined, such as increased use of genomics and molecular genetics, computational and bioinformatics approaches, ecological developmental biology (eco-devo), and phylogenetically informed comparative embryology.

In particular, this study revealed that, in spite of matrix sensitivity to proteases (e.g. MMP) and the presence of cell-integrin binding sites, at high stiffness (elastic modulus, G' > 1200 Pa) the matrix acts as a barrier for cells cultured in 3D. Finally, a comparison between the biomimetic PEG-based and collagen gels indicated that differences in their viscoelastic behaviours, determined by the nature of network structures and cross-links, may influence the mechanism(s) cells employ to remodel their 3D extracellular microenvironment. In conclusion, these studies highlight that for proliferation in 3D, compared to 2D, cells require strategies to overcome the physical impediment posed by the matrix. We also demonstrate that by exploiting the design flexibility of the characteristics offered by these biomimetic hydrogels, it is possible to separately investigate complex aspects characterizing the cell matrix interactions in 3D, this has the potential to have great impact in regenerative medicine, as well as in cell biology and cancer research.

UVB exposure resulted in the overexpression of the cytokines, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6 and the adhesion molecule P-cadherin. Infiltration into the dermal compartment of mast cell populations was also induced. These factors are also overexpressed in psoriatic skin. The effect of topical applications of two isoflavonoids, equol and a synthetic analogue NV-38, was tested. Both isoflavonoids dose dependently inhibited the UVB induction of cutaneous TNF-alpha mRNA and protein, a cytokine critical for the initiation of psoriatic inflammation.

In the face of these enormous challenges, biomass has emerged as a viable alternative to petroleum for the production of energy, chemicals, and materials owing to its abundance, inexpensiveness, and carbon-neutrality. Moreover, the immense ease and efficiency of biological systems at converting biomass-derived feedstocks into fuels, chemicals, and materials has generated renewed interest in biotechnology as a replacement for traditional chemical processes. Aided by the ever-expanding repertoire of microbial genetics and plant biotechnology, improved understanding of gene regulation and cellular metabolism, and incessantly accumulating gene and protein data, scientists are now contemplating engineering microbial cell factories to produce fuels, chemical feedstocks, polymers and pharmaceuticals in an economically and environmentally sustainable way. This goal resonates with that of metabolic engineering the improvement of cellular properties through the intelligent design, rational modification, or directed evolution of biochemical pathways, and arguably, metabolic engineering seems best positioned to achieve the concomittant goals of environmental stewardship and economic prolificity. Improving a host organism's cellular traits and the potential design of new phenotypes is strongly dependent on the ability to effectively control the organism's genetic machinery. In fact, finely-tuned gene expression is imperative for achieving an optimal balance between pathway expression and cell viability, while avoiding cytotoxicity due to accumulation of certain gene products or metabolites. Early attempts to engineer a cell's metabolism almost exclusively relied on merely deleting or over-expressing single or multiple genes using recombinant DNA, and intervention targets were predominantly selected based on knowledge of the stoichiometry, kinetics, and regulation of the pathway of interest. However, the distributive nature of metabolic control, as opposed to the existence of a single rate-limiting step, predicates the controlled expression of multiple enzymes in several coordinated pathways to achieve the desired flux, and, as such, simple strategies involving either deleting or over-expressing genes are greatly limited in this context. On the other hand, the use of synthetic or modified promoters, riboswitches, tunable intergenic regions, and translation modulators such as internal ribosome entry sequences, upstream open reading frames, optimized mRNA secondary structures, and RNA silencing have been shown to be enormously conducive to achieving the fine-tuning of gene expression. These modifications to the genetic machinery of the host organism can be best achieved via the use of synthetic DNA technology, and the constant improvement in the affordability and quality of oligonucleotide synthesis suggests that these might well become the mainstay of the metabolic engineering toolbox in the years to come.

Metabolic engineering and pathway optimization with the aim to reduce costs and increase productivity are the main focus of academia and industry. Until now, only a limited number of plant cell cultures and isolated enzymes gave sufficiently high production for commercial purposes. Therefore research strategies have been shifted to metabolic engineering. Engineering of microorganisms has proven to be a valuable tool and the concept has been transferred to plant science opening new promising perspectives. Engineering has been conducted for crop plants, but the application of this technique to medicinal plants has not yet been explored well so far. Nowadays the cloning and expression of multiple genes and genomic integration are of high interest. This allows the reconstitution of biosynthetic pathways in heterologous organisms, being either plants or microorganisms. Combining basic science and applied engineering in this research area has been named combinatorial biosynthesis and later as synthetic biology.

Eribulin, with proven preclinical activity, is a synthetic halichondrin analog with novel actions on tubulin including suppression of microtubule polymerization. Phase I and II studies in MBC identified neutropenia as the dose-limiting toxicity and a maximum tolerated dose of 1.4mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. An encouraging response rate of 11.5% in refractory MBC led to the launch of the phase III Eisai Metastatic Breast Cancer Study Assessing Physician's Choice versus Eribulin trial, in which heavily pretreated patients with MBC were randomized 2:1 to intravenous eribulin or monotherapy of the investigator's choice. Recently, it was reported that this important study of 762 patients met its primary endpoint of overall survival: eribulin was associated with an improvement in median overall survival from 10.65 months to 13.12 months (hazard ratio 0.8, 95% confidence interval 0.66-0.99) and a response rate of 12.2%.

These findings show that eribulin is potentially a new active agent for MBC, although results of ongoing studies are awaited to confirm the reported benefit.

Here, we focus on the p53 signaling pathway as a template for constructing a tunable oscillator comprised of both natural and synthetic components in mammalian cells. We find that a reduced p53 circuit implementing a single feedback loop preserves some features of the full network's dynamics, exhibiting pulses of p53 with tightly controlled timing. However, in contrast to the full natural p53 network, these pulses are damped in individual cells, with amplitude that depends on the input strength. Guided by a computational model of the reduced circuit, we constructed and analyzed circuit variants supplemented with synthetic positive and negative feedback loops and subjected to chemical perturbation. Our work demonstrates that three important features of oscillator dynamics-amplitude, period, and the rate of damping-can be controlled by manipulating stimulus level, interaction strength, and feedback topology.

In this article, we present GENIE3, a new algorithm for the inference of GRNs that was best performer in the DREAM4 In Silico Multifactorial challenge. GENIE3 decomposes the prediction of a regulatory network between p genes into p different regression problems. In each of the regression problems, the expression pattern of one of the genes (target gene) is predicted from the expression patterns of all the other genes (input genes), using tree-based ensemble methods Random Forests or Extra-Trees. The importance of an input gene in the prediction of the target gene expression pattern is taken as an indication of a putative regulatory link. Putative regulatory links are then aggregated over all genes to provide a ranking of interactions from which the whole network is reconstructed. In addition to performing well on the DREAM4 In Silico Multifactorial challenge simulated data, we show that GENIE3 compares favorably with existing algorithms to decipher the genetic regulatory network of Escherichia coli. It doesn't make any assumption about the nature of gene regulation, can deal with combinatorial and non-linear interactions, produces directed GRNs, and is fast and scalable.

A new tool in cell biology is denoted \"optogenetics\" which describes the use of genetically encoded, light-gated proteins, i.e. photoreceptors, which perturb and control cellular and organismal behavior in a spatiotemporally exact manner. Photoreceptors resemble fluorescent reporter proteins such as GFP in being genetically encoded, non-invasive, and applicable to intact cells and organisms. They are explicitly intended to modulate activity, in contrast, fluorescent proteins generally do not disturb the processes under study. Fluorescent proteins have revolutionized cell biology because they allow the monitoring of such processes by imaging techniques that offer superb spatiotemporal resolution and sensitivity. Optogenetics extends these advantages to offer control. The scope of optogenetics has recently been expanded beyond the use of naturally occurring photoreceptors by the biologically-inspired design of engineered (or synthetic) photoreceptors. These photoreceptors are derived by fusion of one or more light-absorbing sensor domains with an output or effector domain displaying the activity to be controlled. Here, we focus on the design and application of such engineered photoreceptors. We treat basic signaling principles and discuss the two photosensor classes which are currently most widely used in fusion-based design: LOV domains and phytochromes.

Preliminary estimates of the surface density of the ligands of these two major collagen-binding receptors are 5775 +/- 2064 ligands mu m(-2) for ligands of alpha(1)beta(1) and 17 084 +/- 5353 ligands mu m(-2) for ligands of alpha(2)beta(1). The proposed methodology can be used to quantify the surface chemistry of insoluble surfaces that possess biological activity, such as native tissue ECM and biomaterials, and therefore can be used in cell biology, biomaterials science and regenerative medical studies for quantitative description of a matrix and its effects on cells."}},{"pk": "14098", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "26", "pubYear": 2010, "doi": "10.1093/bioinformatics/btq409", "sbw": 0, "title": "BioNetCAD: design, simulation and experimental validation of synthetic biochemical networks", "pubMonth": "9", "journal": 1011, "abstract": "Motivation: Synthetic biology studies how to design and construct biological systems with functions that do not exist in nature.

Within the stochastic framework, the base pairing strength between sRNA and mRNA plays an important role in controlling the transition time between on and off states. The noise strength of protein number in the off state approaches 1 and is smaller than that in the on state.

More recently, increased clinical use of locally delivered GC has shown significant benefit for the treatment of multiple retinal indications including macular edema associated with uveitis, retinal vascular occlusions and diabetes. Our current understanding of the clinical utility of specific intraocular GC far surpasses our knowledge of their biologic and pharmacologic activities in the eye. Objective: To present an update on GC receptor (GR) biology in general and as it applies to the eye, and discuss the pharmacokinetics, delivery and pharmacology of the commonly used intraocular GC dexamethasone (DEX), triamcinolone acetonide (TA) and fluocinolone acetonide (FA). Results: DEX, TA and FA are structurally similar but significantly differentiated by their aqueous and lipid solubility, delivery system requirements, pharmacokinetics and interactions with functional GR. Culture of human trabecular meshwork cells and full transcriptome microarray analysis reveals that DEX, TA and FA generate unique gene transactivation and repression profiles as well as potentially distinct biologic responses that are not only steroid structure dependent, but also dose and time dependent. Finally, DEX and FA markedly protect photoreceptors from degenerating in animal models of excessive light and retinitis pigmentosa, respectively. Conclusion: It is tempting to speculate that the unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacologic profiles of the commonly used intraocular steroids and novel future drugs may reveal significant differences in their therapeutic value in patients with macular edema or other inflammatory disease, in their ocular adverse side effect profile, and their ability to normalize glial and neuronal function in diseased retina.

The trpA-E genes along with 'regulatory' elements were delivered as individual recombination cassettes in a synthetic integron platform. Integrase-mediated recombination generated thousands of genetic combinations overnight.

Thrombospondins (TSPs) are extracellular, calcium-binding glycoproteins that have biologically important roles in mammals in angiogenesis, vascular biology, connective tissues, immune response, and synaptogenesis. The evolution of these complex functional properties is poorly understood. We report here on the evolution of TSPs and their ligand-binding capacities, from comparative genomics of species representing the major phyla of metazoa and experimental analyses of the oligomerization properties of noncanonical TSPs of basal deuterostomes. Monomeric, dimeric, trimeric, and pentameric TSPs have arisen through separate evolutionary events involving gain, loss, or modification of a coiled-coil domain or distinct domains at the amino-terminus. The relative transience of monomeric forms under evolution implicates a biological importance for multivalency of the C-terminal region of TSPs. Most protostomes have a single TSP gene encoding a pentameric TSP. The pentameric form is also present in deuterostomes, and gene duplications at the origin of deuterostomes and gene loss and further gene duplication events in the vertebrate lineage gave rise to distinct forms and novel domain architectures. Parallel analysis of the major ligands of mammalian TSPs revealed that many binding activities are neofunctions representing either coevolutionary innovations in the deuterostome lineage or neofunctions of ancient molecules such as CD36. Contrasting widely conserved capacities include binding to heparan glycosaminoglycans, fibrillar collagen, or RGD-dependent integrins. These findings identify TSPs as fundamental components of the extracellular interaction systems of metazoa and thus impact understanding of the evolution of ECM networks. The widely conserved activities of TSPs in binding to ECM components or PS2 clade integrins will be relevant to use of TSPs in synthetic extracellular matrices or tissue engineering. In contrast, the neofunctions of vertebrate TSPs likely include interactions suitable for therapeutic targeting without general disruption of ECM."}},{"pk": "14496", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "25", "pubYear": 2010, "doi": "10.1179/175355510X12723642365368", "sbw": 0, "title": "Multicomponent and hybrid hydrogels comprised of carbon nanotube-nickel/nickel oxide core/shell nanoparticle heterostructures incorporated in polyvinyl alcohol", "pubMonth": "9", "journal": 14495, "abstract": "Carbon nanotube (CNT) nickel/nickel oxide (Ni/NiO) core/shell nanoparticles (CNC) hetero-structures were prepared in a facile and single step synthetic route.

As Kihara's career illustrates, Japanese genetics developed quickly in the early twentieth century through interactions with biologists outside Japan. The interactions, however, ceased due to the war in the late 1930s, and Japanese geneticists were mostly isolated from outside information until the late 1940s. During the isolation in wartime and under the postwar U.S. Occupation, Kihara adapted to political changes. During wartime, he developed a research institute focusing on applied biology of various crops, which conformed to the national need to address food scarcity. After the war, he led the campaign for the establishment of a national institute of genetics and negotiated with American Occupation officers. The Americans viewed this Japanese effort with suspicion because of the rising popularity of the controversial theory of the Russian agronomist, Trofim Lysenko, in Japan. The institute was approved in 1949 partly because Kihara was able to bridge the gap between the American and Japanese sides. With Kihara's flexible and generous leadership, Japanese genetics steadily developed, survived the wartime, and recovered quickly in the postwar period. The article discusses Kihara's interest in cytoplasmic inheritance and his synthetic approach to genetics in this political context, and draws attention to the relation between Kihara's genetics and agricultural practice in Japan."}},{"pk": "14548", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "401", "pubYear": 2010, "doi": "10.1016/j.jmb.2010.06.051", "sbw": 0, "title": "Positive Autoregulation Shapes Response Timing and Intensity in Two-component Signal Transduction Systems", "pubMonth": "8", "journal": 1973, "abstract": "Positive feedback loops are regulatory elements that can modulate expression output, kinetics and noise in genetic circuits.

Using a mathematical model of two-component regulatory systems, which are present in all domains of life, we establish that positive feedback strongly affects the steady-state output levels at both low and high levels of stimulus if the constitutive promoter of the regulator is weak. By contrast, the effect of positive feedback is negligible when the constitutive promoter is sufficiently strong, unless the stimulus intensity is very high. Furthermore, we determine that positive feedback can affect both transient and steady state output levels even in the simplest genetic regulatory systems.

We demonstrate here that if this is done with typical weighted least-squares methods, the result is a bias of relative size between -2/n and + 1/n on the value of the fitted diffusion coefficient. Here, n is the number of power spectra averaged over, so typical calibrations contain 10%-20% bias. Both the sign and the size of the bias depend on the weighting scheme applied. Hence, so do length-scale calibrations based on the diffusion coefficient. The fitted value for the characteristic frequency is not affected by this bias. For the AFM then, force measurements are not affected provided an independent length-scale calibration is available. For optical tweezers there is no such luck, since the spring constant is found as the ratio of the characteristic frequency and the diffusion coefficient. We give analytical results for the weight-dependent bias for the wide class of systems whose dynamics is described by a linear (integro)differential equation with additive noise, white or colored. Examples are optical tweezers with hydrodynamic self-interaction and aliasing, calibration of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models in finance, models for cell migration in biology, etc. Because the bias takes the form of a simple multiplicative factor on the fitted amplitude (e.g. the diffusion coefficient), it is straightforward to remove and the user will need minimal modifications to his or her favorite least-squares fitting programs.

As a first step toward RNA recognition, we utilized the RNA binding domain of argonaute, implicated in RNA interference, for specifically targeting generic 2-nucleotide, 3' overhangs of any dsRNA. We tested the reassembly of a split-luciferase enzyme guided by argonaute-mediated recognition of newly generated nucleotide overhangs when ssRNA is targeted by a designed complementary guide sequence. This approach was successful when argonaute was utilized in conjunction with a pumilio repeat and expanded the scope of potential ssRNA targets.

We next designed and tested a second hierarchical assembly, wherein ssDNA guides are appended to DNA hairpins that serve as a scaffold for high affinity zinc fingers attached to split-luciferase. In the presence of a ssRNA target containing adjacent sequences complementary to the guides, the hairpins are brought into proximity, allowing for zinc finger binding and concomitant reassembly of the fragmented luciferase. The scope of this new approach was validated by specifically targeting RNA encoding VEGF, hDM2, and HER2. These approaches provide potentially general design paradigms for the conditional reassembly of fragmented proteins in the presence of any desired ssRNA target."}},{"pk": "14616", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "39", "pubYear": 2010, "doi": "10.1039/c0cs00032a", "sbw": 0, "title": "More than just bare scaffolds: towards multi-component and decorated fibrous biomaterials", "pubMonth": "0", "journal": 1558, "abstract": "We are entering a new phase in biomaterials research in which rational design is being used to produce functionalised materials tailored to specific applications. As is evident from this Themed Issue, there are now a number of distinct types of designed, self-assembling, fibrous biomaterials. Many of these are ripe for development and application for example as scaffolds for 3D cell culture and tissue engineering, and in templating inorganic materials. Whilst a number of groups are making headway towards such applications, there is a general challenge to translate a wealth of excellent basic research into materials with a genuine future in real-life applications. Amongst other contemporary aspects of this evolving research area, a key issue is that of decorating or functionalising what are mostly bare scaffolds. There are a number of hurdles to overcome to achieve effective and controlled labelling of the scaffolds, for instance: maintaining biocompatibility, i.e., by minimising covalent chemistry, or using milder bioconjugation methods, attaining specified levels of decoration, and, in particular, high and stoichiometric labelling, introducing orthogonality, such that two or more functions can be appended to the same scaffold, and, in relevant cases, maintaining the possibility for recombinant peptide/protein production. In this critical review, we present an overview of the different approaches to tackling these challenges largely for self-assembled, peptide-based fibrous systems. We review the field as it stands by placing work within general routes to fibre functionalisation, give worked examples on our own specific system, the SAFs, and explore the potential for future developments in the area. Our feeling is that by tackling the challenges of designing multi-component and functional biomaterials, as a community we stand to learn a great deal about self-assembling biomolecular systems more broadly, as well as, hopefully, delivering new materials that will be truly useful in biotechnology and biomedical applications (107 references)."}},{"pk": "14621", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "36", "pubYear": 2010, "doi": "10.1002/biof.102", "sbw": 0, "title": "Insilico studies of organosulfur-functional active compounds in garlic", "pubMonth": "7", "journal": 14620, "abstract": "Garlic has been used medicinally since antiquity because of its antimicrobial activity, anticancer activity, antioxidant activity, ability to reduce cardiovascular diseases, improving immune functions, and antidiabetic activities and also in reducing cardiovascular diseases and improving immune functions.

We examined association of IPR212C into homo-and heterodimeric receptor complexes and the impact on prostacyclin and thromboxane biology. Methods and Results-Dimerization of the IP, IPR212C, and TP alpha was examined by bioluminesence resonance energy transfer in transfected HEK293 cells. We observed an equal propensity for formation of IPIP homodimers and IPTP alpha heterodimers. Compared with the IP alone, IPR212C displayed reduced cAMP generation and increased endoplasmic reticulum localization but underwent normal homo-and heterodimerization. When the IPR212C and IP were coexpressed, a dominant negative action of the variant was evident with enhanced wild-type IP localization to the endoplasmic reticulum and reduced agonist-dependent signaling. Further, the TP alpha activation response, which was shifted from inositol phosphate to cAMP generation following IPTP alpha heterodimerization, was normalized when the TP alpha instead dimerized with IPR212C. Conclusion-IPR212C exerts a dominant action on the wild-type IP and TP alpha through dimerization.

Because chemical perturbations offer opportunities often not accessible with genetic methods, the development of small-molecule modulators of protein function is at the heart of chemical biology research. In this endeavor, the identification of biologically relevant starting points within the vast chemical space available for the design of compound collections is a particularly relevant, yet difficult, task. In this Account, we present our research aimed at linking chemical and biological space to define suitable starting points that guide the synthesis of compound collections with biological relevance. Both protein folds and natural product (NP) scaffolds are highly conserved in nature. Whereas different amino acid sequences can make up ligand-binding sites in proteins with highly similar fold types, differently substituted NPs characterized by particular scaffold classes often display diverse biological activities. Therefore, we hypothesized that (i) ligand-binding sites with similar ligand-sensing cores embedded in their folds would bind NPs with similar scaffolds and (ii) selectivity is ensured by variation of both amino add side chains and NP substituents. To investigate this notion in compound library design, we developed an approach termed biology-oriented synthesis (BIOS). BIOS employs chem- and bioinformatic methods for mapping biologically relevant chemical space and protein space to generate hypotheses for compound collection design and synthesis. BIOS also provides hypotheses for potential bioactivity of compound library members. On the one hand, protein structure similarity clustering (PSSC) is used to identify ligand binding sites with high subfold similarity, that is, high structural similarity in their ligand-sensing cores. On the other hand, structural classification by scaffold trees (for example, structural classification of natural products or SCONP), when combined with software tools like \"Scaffold Hunter\", enables the hierarchical structural classification of small-molecule collections in tree-like arrangements, their annotation with bioactivity data, and the intuitive navigation of chemical space. Brachiation (in a manner analogous to tree-swinging primates) within the scaffold trees serves to identify new starting points for the design and synthesis of small-molecule libraries, and PSSC may be used to select potential protein targets. The introduction of chemical diversity in compound collections designed according to the logic of BIOS is essential for the frequent identification of small molecules with diverse biological activities. The continuing development of synthetic methodology, both on solid phase and in solution, enables the generation of focused small-molecule collections with sufficient substituent stereochemical, and scaffold diversity to yield comparatively high hit rates in biochemical and biological screens from relatively small libraries. BIOS has also allowed the identification of new ligand classes for several different proteins and chemical probes for the study of protein function in cells."}},{"pk": "14764", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "688", "pubYear": 2010, "doi": "", "sbw": 0, "title": "An Overview of Sphingolipid Metabolism: From Synthesis to Breakdown", "pubMonth": "0", "journal": 14763, "abstract": "Sphingolipids constitute a class of lipids defined by their eighteen carbon amino-alcohol backbones which are synthesized in the ER from nonsphingolipid precursors. Modification of this basic structure is what gives rise to the vast family of sphingolipids that play significant roles in membrane biology and provide many bioactive metabolites that regulate cell function. Despite the diversity of structure and function of sphingolipids, their creation and destruction are governed by common synthetic and catabolic pathways. In this regard, sphingolipid metabolism can be imagined as an array of interconnected networks that diverge from a single common entry point and converge into a single common breakdown pathway. In their simplest forms, sphingosine, phytosphingosine and dihydrosphingosine serve as the backbones upon which further complexity is achieved. For example, phosphorylation of the C 1 hydroxyl group yields the final breakdown products and/or the important signaling molecules sphingosine-1-phosphate, phytosphingosine-1-phosphate and dihydrosphingosine-l-phosphate, respectively. On the other hand, acylation of sphingosine, phytosphingosine, or dihydrosphingosine with one of several possible acyl CoA molecules through the action of distinct ceramide synthases produces the molecules defined as ceramide, phytoceramide, or dihydroceramide. Ceramide, due to the differing acyl CoAs that can be used to produce it, is technically a class of molecules rather than a single molecule and therefore may have different biological functions depending on the acyl chain it is composed of. At the apex of complexity is the group of lipids known as glycosphingolipids (GSL) which contain dozens of different sphingolipid species differing by both the order and type of sugar residues attached to their headgroups. Since these molecules are produced from ceramide precursors, they too may have differences in their acyl chain composition, revealing an additional layer of variation. The glycosphingolipids are divided broadly into two categories: glucosphingolipids and galactosphingolipids. The glucosphingolipids depend initially on the enzyme glucosylceramide synthase (G CS) which attaches glucose as the first residue to the Cl hydroxyl position. Galactosphingolipids, on the other hand, are generated from galactosylceramide synthase (GalCerS), an evolutionarily dissimilar enzyme from GCS. Glycosphingolipids are further divided based upon further modification by various glycosyltransferases which increases the potential variation in lipid species by several fold. Far more abundant are the sphingomyelin species which are produced in parallel with glycosphingolipids, however they are defined by a phosphocholine headgroup rather than the addition of sugar residues. Although sphingomyelin species all share a common headgroup, they too are produced from a variety of ceramide species and therefore can have differing acyl chains attached to their C-2 amino groups. Whether or not the differing acyl chain lengths in SMs dictate unique functions or important biophysical distinctions has not yet been established. Understanding the function of all the existing glycosphingolipids and sphingomyelin species will be a major undertaking in the future since the tools to study and measure these species are only beginning to be developed (see Fig 1 for an illustrated depiction of the various sphingolipid structures). The simple sphingolipids serve both as the precursors and the breakdown products of the more complex ones. Importantly, in recent decades, these simple sphingolipids have gained attention for having significant signaling and regulatory roles within cells. In addition, many tools have emerged to measure the levels of simple sphingolipids and therefore have become the focus of even more intense study in recent years. With this thought in mind, this chapter will pay tribute to the complex sphingolipids, but focus on the regulation of simple sphingolipid metabolism."}},{"pk": "14776", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "82", "pubYear": 2010, "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevE.82.021911", "sbw": 0, "title": "Minimal genetic device with multiple tunable functions", "pubMonth": "8", "journal": 3779, "abstract": "The ability to design artificial genetic devices with predictable functions is critical to the development of synthetic biology.

Here, we have developed a minimal synthetic genetic system that acts as a multifunction, tunable biodevice in the bacterium Escherichia coli. First, it acts as a biochemical AND gate, sensing the extracellular small molecules isopropyl beta-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside and anhydrotetracycline as two input signals and expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein as an output signal. Next, the output signal of the AND gate can be amplified by the application of another extracellular chemical, arabinose. Further, the system can generate a wide range of chemically tunable single input-output response curves, without any genetic alteration of the circuit, by varying the concentrations of a set of extracellular small molecules.

Here, we introduce for the first time a method for predicting catalytic and substrate promiscuity using a graph-based representation known as molecular signature. Results: Our method, which has an accuracy of 85% for the non-redundant KEGG database, is also a powerful analytical tool for characterizing structural determinants of protein promiscuity.

In contrast, those signatures that act as promiscuity determinants are significantly depleted around non-promiscuous catalytic sites. In addition, we present the study of the enolase and aminotransferase superfamilies as illustrative examples of characterization of promiscuous enzymes within a superfamily and achievement of enzyme promiscuity by protein reverse engineering.

The important small biomolecule heme directly modulates in vivo and in vitro the beta-lactamase activity of selected integral fusion proteins. The presence of heme decreased the concentration of ampicillin tolerated by Escherichia coli and the level of in vitro hydrolysis of nitrocefin by up to 2 orders of magnitude. Variants with the largest switching magnitudes contained insertions at second-shell sites that abut key catalytic residues. Spectrophotometry confirmed that heme bound to the integral fusion proteins in a manner similar to that of cytochrome b(562). Circular dichroism suggested that only subtle structural changes rather than gross folding-unfolding events were responsible for modulating beta-lactamase activity, and size exclusion chromatography confirmed that the integral fusion proteins remained monomeric in both the apo and holo forms.

By alternative splicing the IGF-1 gene produces several different transcripts, including IGF-1Ec (MGF). The latter has been mainly associated with muscle regeneration processes. METHODS. We used immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, and Western analysis to show the expression status of MGF in prostate tissue and human prostate cell lines (HPrEC, PC-3, and LNCaP) and we studied the exogenous administration of the MGF peptide E on cellular proliferation using trypan blue and MTT assays, before and after the silencing of the IGF-1 receptor and insulin receptor (siRNA methods). The MGF-induced intracellular activation was examined by Western analysis of the active forms of ERK1/2 and Akt. RESULTS. We documented that MGF is overexpressed in human prostate cancer (PCa) tissues and in human PC-3 and LNCaP cells. Notably, MGF expression was remarkably higher in PCa and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) than normal prostate tissues, while the normal prostate epithelial cells (HPrEC) did not express MGF. Exogenous administration of a synthetic MGF E peptide stimulated the PCa cell growth and activated ERK1/2 phosphorylation without affecting Akt phosphorylation. IGF-1R or insulin receptor (IR) silencing did not affect the mitogenic activity and intracellular signaling of the MGF E peptide in these PCa cells. CONCLUSIONS. These data suggest the possible implication of MGF E peptide in cancer biology, implying a preferential MGF expression in PCa tissues and cells. This preferential IGF-1 mRNA expression generates the MGF E peptide that possesses mitogenic activity through mechanisms independent of IGF-1R, IR, and hybrid IGF-1R/IR. Prostate 70:1233-1242, 2010.

Instead, oscillations were likely due to density-dependent plasmid amplification that established a population-level negative feedback.

This 'bryophyte paradox', i.e. that sex ratios are biased in favour of the sex associated with the highest reproductive costs, has remained unexplained. 2. Analysis of sex-ratio patterns via the influence of sex distribution on population growth rates (lambda) has not previously been carried out for bryophytes. We used this method to model how variation in sex ratio and sporophyte frequency influences lambda in the clonal bryophyte Hylocomium splendens. We obtained lambda by matrix modelling of synthetic experimental populations derived from demographic field data, using a linear two-sex model. 3. In our set of experimental populations lambda varied between 1.13 and 1.27 in response to variation in sex ratio and sporophyte frequency, with the highest lambda obtained for the combination of a very low sporophyte frequency and a slightly female-biased sex ratio. 4. Our results explain the female-biased sex ratio of H. splendens by the slightly lower survival of and production of vegetative offspring by males than by non-sporophytic females. 5. Synthesis. According to our models, female dominance is the predicted outcome of low to moderate fertilization success and male performance intermediate between that of sporophytic and of non-sporophytic females. Our results therefore explain how a female-biased sex ratio can be maintained despite higher costs of reproduction in females than in males. In dioecious bryophytes, males and females must grow in close contact for fertilization to take place. Better performance of male ramets than of the female ramets they fertilize also explains how male clones can expand into female clones. A similar performance hierarchy of males and females may occur in unisexual clonal seed plants, but more efficient fertilization systems by pollination prevents the selective advantage of unfertilized females from being realized. This explains why vascular plant populations tend to be male biased. We hypothesise difference in fertilization distance range between sperm and pollen as a simple explanation why ramet level sex ratios are in general male dominated in clonal seed plants and female dominated in clonal bryophytes."}},{"pk": "15084", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "34", "pubYear": 2010, "doi": "10.1111/j.1574-6976.2010.00238.x", "sbw": 0, "title": "Engineering input/output nodes in prokaryotic regulatory circuits", "pubMonth": "9", "journal": 6507, "abstract": "A large number of prokaryotic regulatory elements have been interfaced artificially with biological circuits that execute specific expression programs.

These include transcriptional regulators developed by in vitro evolution (or designed from scratch), and synthetic riboswitches derived from in vitro selection of aptamers. Then we examine recent progress on reporter genes, whose expression allows the quantification and parametrization of signal-responding circuits in their entirety. Finally, we critically examine recent work on other reporters that confer bacteria with gross organoleptic properties (e.g. distinct odour) and the interfacing of signal-sensing devices with determinants of community behaviour."}},{"pk": "15124", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "5", "pubYear": 2010, "doi": "10.1002/biot.201000129", "sbw": 0, "title": "Metabolic systems analysis to advance algal biotechnology", "pubMonth": "7", "journal": 1786, "abstract": "Algal fuel sources promise unsurpassed yields in a carbon neutral manner that minimizes resource competition between agriculture and fuel crops. Many challenges must be addressed before algal biofuels can be accepted as a component of the fossil fuel replacement strategy.

Algal biofuel production presents the opportunity to fine-tune microbial metabolic machinery for an optimal blend of biomass constituents and desired fuel molecules. Genome-scale model-driven algal metabolic design promises to facilitate both goals by directing the utilization of metabolites in the complex, interconnected metabolic networks to optimize production of the compounds of interest. Network analysis can direct microbial development efforts towards successful strategies and enable quantitative fine-tuning of the network for optimal product yields while maintaining the robustness of the production microbe. Metabolic modeling yields insights into microbial function, guides experiments by generating testable hypotheses, and enables the refinement of knowledge on the specific organism.

This approach requires development of new compounds that activate specific receptor targets to downregulate the cellular and tissue pathways operative in the host during inflammation. Here we dwell on a family of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) termed FPRs, acronym for formyl-peptide receptors. With three and seven members in man and mouse, respectively, these receptors harness many biological functions, spanning odour perception and hair growth, to the control of multiple facets (pain, cell migration, oxidative burst, xenobiotic engulfment) of the inflammatory reaction. We focus on FPR biology with particular attention to molecules able to produce pharmacological effects by interacting with these GPCRs, describing endogenous agonists of FPRs and, more relevantly, the current development of synthetic agonists. Besides being potential leads for the development of the anti-inflammatory therapeutics of the future, these compounds could also help clarify the properties and roles that each FPR might play in the complex network of pathways that is inflammation. We conclude that FPR2 agonists could be valid warhorses for defining a novel philosophy for anti-inflammatory drug discovery programmes: mimicking - with new compounds - the way our body disposes of inflammation could be a viable approach to regulate aberrant inflammatory responses as in the case of several chronic rheumatic and cardiovascular pathologies.

It is increasingly realized that academic biomedical research institutions ought to be engaged in early-stage drug discovery, especially when it can be coupled to their basic research. To leverage the productivity of new-drug development, a substantial acceleration in validation of new therapeutic targets is required, which would require small molecules that can precisely control target functions in complex biological systems in a temporal and dose-dependent manner. In this review, we describe a process of integration of small-molecule discovery and chemistry in academic biomedical research that will ideally bring together the elements of innovative approaches to new molecular targets, existing basic and clinical research, screening infrastructure, and synthetic and medicinal chemistry to follow up on small-molecule hits. Such integration of multidisciplinary resources and expertise will enable academic investigators to discover novel small molecules that are expected to facilitate their efforts in both mechanistic research and new-drug target validation.

Mobile objects map to compounds. One analogue represents a cross-section through a lobule. It is comprised of 460 identical, quasi-autonomous functional units called sinusoidal segments (SSs). SSs detect and respond to compound-generated response signals and the local level of an endogenous gradient. Each SS adapts by using those signals to adjust (or not) the probability that it will clear a detected compound during the next simulation cycle. The adjustment decision is based on the value of a biomimetic algorithm that is based on an assumed, evolution imposed, genetic mandate that normal hepatocytes resist increasing the cost of their actions. The algorithm estimates the long-term, discounted cost to a given SS of continuing to use its current clearance effort. Upon compound exposure, lobular analogues developed a variety of clearance and hepatotoxicity patterns that were strikingly similar to those reported in the literature.

A number of studies have been reported for improving this expression system. However, its physiology and cellular metabolism still remained largely uncharacterized. Thus, it is highly desirable to establish a systems biotechnological framework, in which a comprehensive in silico model of P. pastoris can be employed together with high throughput experimental data analysis, for better understanding of the methylotrophic yeast's metabolism. Results: A fully compartmentalized metabolic model of P. pastoris (iPP668), composed of 1,361 reactions and 1,177 metabolites, was reconstructed based on its genome annotation and biochemical information. The constraints-based flux analysis was then used to predict achievable growth rate which is consistent with the cellular phenotype of P. pastoris observed during chemostat experiments. Subsequent in silico analysis further explored the effect of various carbon sources on cell growth, revealing sorbitol as a promising candidate for culturing recombinant P. pastoris strains producing heterologous proteins. Interestingly, methanol consumption yields a high regeneration rate of reducing equivalents which is substantial for the synthesis of valuable pharmaceutical precursors. Hence, as a case study, we examined the applicability of P. pastoris system to whole-cell biotransformation and also identified relevant metabolic engineering targets that have been experimentally verified. Conclusion: The genome-scale metabolic model characterizes the cellular physiology of P. pastoris, thus allowing us to gain valuable insights into the metabolism of methylotrophic yeast and devise possible strategies for strain improvement through in silico simulations.

However, our understanding is rather limited to the relationship between double concurrent perturbation and various higher level phenotypic changes, e. g. those in cells, tissues or organs. Modifier screens, such as synthetic genetic arrays (SGA) can help us to understand the phenotype caused by combined gene mutations. Unfortunately, exhaustive tests on all possible combined mutations in any genome are vulnerable to combinatorial explosion and are infeasible either technically or financially. Therefore, an accurate computational approach to predict genetic interaction is highly desirable, and such methods have the potential of alleviating the bottleneck on experiment design. Results: In this work, we introduce a computational systems biology approach for the accurate prediction of pairwise synthetic genetic interactions (SGI). First, a high-coverage and high-precision functional gene network (FGN) is constructed by integrating protein-protein interaction (PPI), protein complex and gene expression data, then, a graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) classifier is utilized to identify SGI, where the topological properties of protein pairs in weighted FGN is used as input features of the classifier. We compare the proposed SSL method with the state-of-the-art supervised classifier, the support vector machines (SVM), on a benchmark dataset in S. cerevisiae to validate our method's ability to distinguish synthetic genetic interactions from non-interaction gene pairs. Experimental results show that the proposed method can accurately predict genetic interactions in S. cerevisiae (with a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 91%). Noticeably, the SSL method is more efficient than SVM, especially for very small training sets and large test sets. Conclusions: We developed a graph-based SSL classifier for predicting the SGI. The classifier employs topological properties of weighted FGN as input features and simultaneously employs information induced from labelled and unlabelled data. Our analysis indicates that the topological properties of weighted FGN can be employed to accurately predict SGI. Also, the graph-based SSL method outperforms the traditional standard supervised approach, especially when used with small training sets. The proposed method can alleviate experimental burden of exhaustive test and provide a useful guide for the biologist in narrowing down the candidate gene pairs with SGI.

Expanding on this work, we constructed a new implementation of a common coupled feedback loop architecture by incorporating the LuxR transcriptional activator as the positive feedback element. We found that the properties of the LuxR activator had a significant impact on the observed behavior of the coupled feedback loop circuit, as a slow degradation rate of LuxR led to its accumulation after initial circuit induction. Due to this accumulation, the presence of feedback on LuxR did not greatly alter the oscillatory behavior of the circuit from a control consisting of an independent negative feedback loop, with both systems showing oscillatory responses in 30-40% of the measured cells and highly variable periods. While the oscillatory properties of individual cells were not influenced by induction levels, the percentage of cells that demonstrated oscillations was. Slight improvements to the initial responses of the coupled feedback loop circuit were also obtained by coexpression of the GroE chaperones due to improved LuxR folding.

For all glycoside substrates tested at 50 mm phosphate buffer this catalysis is superior to previously reported results for 6(A),6(D)-dicyanohydrin cyclodextrin (CD) artificial glycosidases, i.e. analogues which have their catalytic group one carbon atom closer to the cyclodextrin cavity. This provides proof of substantial flexibility within the catalysis exerted by these CD chemzymes. A series of permethylated mono- and dicyanohydrin alpha- and beta-CDs were also synthesized, and these showed more modest catalytic rate enhancements of up to 110 times (10% catalysis rate, relative to non-methylated analogues), implying that the permethylation blocks or hampers catalytically important binding between the saccharide part of the substrate and the CD. For comparison, the permethylated 6(A),6(D)-dicarboxylic acid beta-CD was also synthesized and afforded 25% activity (up to 250 times rate increase) relative to the nonpermethylated 6(A),6(D)-dicarboxylic acid beta-CD.

These assays are difficult and in vitro measurements may not approximate actual in vivo conditions. Alternatively, changes in transcription factor activity can be estimated by using partially specified models which estimate the \"hidden functions\" of transcription factor concentration changes, however, non-unique solutions are a potential problem. We have applied a synthetic biology approach to develop reporters that are capable of measuring transcription factor activity in vivo in real time. These synthetic reporters are comprised of a constitutive promoter with an operator site for the specific transcription factor immediately downstream. Thus, increasing transcription factor activity is measured as repression of expression of the transcription factor reporter. Measuring repression instead of activation avoids the complications of non-linear interactions between the transcription factor and RNA polymerase which differs at each promoter. Results: Using these reporters, we show that a simple model is capable of determining the rules of integration for multiple transcriptional inputs at the four promoters of the arabinose catabolic pathway. Furthermore, we show that despite the complex and non-linear changes in cAMP-CRP activity in vivo during diauxic shift, the synthetic transcription factor reporters are capable of measuring real-time changes in transcription factor activity, and the simple model is capable of predicting the dynamic behaviour of the catabolic promoters. Conclusions: Using a synthetic biology approach we show that the in vivo activity of transcription factors can be quantified without the need for measuring intracellular concentrations, binding affinities and reaction rates. Using measured transcription factor activity we show how different promoters can integrate common transcriptional inputs, resulting in distinct expression patterns. The data collected show that cAMP levels in vivo are dynamic and agree with observations showing that cAMP levels show a transient pulse during diauxic shift."}},{"pk": "15899", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "4", "pubYear": 2010, "doi": "10.1186/1752-0509-4-66", "sbw": 0, "title": "Avoiding transcription factor competition at promoter level increases the chances of obtaining oscillation", "pubMonth": "5", "journal": 976, "abstract": "Background: The ultimate goal of synthetic biology is the conception and construction of genetic circuits that are reliable with respect to their designed function (e. g. oscillators, switches). This task remains still to be attained due to the inherent synergy of the biological building blocks and to an insufficient feedback between experiments and mathematical models. Nevertheless, the progress in these directions has been substantial. Results: It has been emphasized in the literature that the architecture of a genetic oscillator must include positive (activating) and negative (inhibiting) genetic interactions in order to yield robust oscillations. Our results point out that the oscillatory capacity is not only affected by the interaction polarity but by how it is implemented at promoter level. For a chosen oscillator architecture, we show by means of numerical simulations that the existence or lack of competition between activator and inhibitor at promoter level affects the probability of producing oscillations and also leaves characteristic fingerprints on the associated period/amplitude features. Conclusions: In comparison with non-competitive binding at promoters, competition drastically reduces the region of the parameters space characterized by oscillatory solutions. Moreover, while competition leads to pulse-like oscillations with long-tail distribution in period and amplitude for various parameters or noisy conditions, the noncompetitive scenario shows a characteristic frequency and confined amplitude values. Our study also situates the competition mechanism in the context of existing genetic oscillators, with emphasis on the Atkinson oscillator."}},{"pk": "15909", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "8", "pubYear": 2010, "doi": "10.1186/1741-7007-8-77", "sbw": 0, "title": "Q&A: Life, synthetic biology and risk", "pubMonth": "6", "journal": 15908, "abstract": ""}},{"pk": "15912", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "27", "pubYear": 2010, "doi": "10.1016/j.nbt.2010.02.012", "sbw": 0, "title": "Prediction and design of DNA and RNA structures", "pubMonth": "7", "journal": 15911, "abstract": "Computational tools for prediction and design of DNA and RNA structures are used for different approaches in nucleic acid research.

However, experimental data usually contain potential sources of uncertainty and thus many experiments are now designed with repeated measurements to better assess such inherent variability. Many computational methods have been proposed to account for the variability in replicates. As yet, there is no model to output expression profiles accounting for replicate information so that a variety of computational models that take the expression profiles as the input data can explore this information without any modification. Results: We propose a methodology which integrates replicate variability into expression profiles, to generate so-called 'true' expression profiles. The study addresses two issues: (i) develop a statistical model that can estimate 'true' expression profiles which are more robust than the average profile, and (ii) extend our previous micro clustering which was designed specifically for clustering time-series expression data. The model utilizes a previously proposed error model and the concept of 'relative difference'. The clustering effectiveness is demonstrated through synthetic data where several methods are compared. We subsequently analyze in vivo rat data to elucidate circadian transcriptional dynamics as well as liver-specific corticosteroid induced changes in gene expression.

While pathway construction is similar to approaches established long ago by Metabolic Engineering, the two methods deviate significantly when it comes to pathway optimization. Synthetic biologists opt for gene-combinatorial methods whereby large numbers of pathways, comprising several combinations of genes from different sources, and their mutants, are evaluated in search for an optimal pathway configuration. Metabolic engineering, on the contrary, aims to optimize pathways by tuning the activity of the intermediate reaction steps. Both, rational methods based on kinetics and regulation, as well as combinatorial methods, typically in this order, are used to this end. We argue that a systematic approach consisting of fine-tuning the properties of individual pathway components, prominently enzymes, is a superior strategy to searches spanning large genetic spaces in engineering optimal microbes for the production of chemical and pharmaceutical products."}},{"pk": "16199", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "10", "pubYear": 2010, "doi": "10.3816/CBC.2010.s.003", "sbw": 0, "title": "Novel Treatment Approaches for Triple-Negative Breast Cancer", "pubMonth": "6", "journal": 16198, "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancers share an aggressive biology, marked by increased recurrence risk and poorer survival compared with hormone receptor-positive subtypes. Few therapeutic trials have specifically focused on triple-negative breast cancer, and the treatment of patients with early-stage triple-negative breast cancer has changed little in the past decade. Over this time, however, attention has shifted to treatment approaches based on molecular subtypes of breast cancer, and investigation into the mechanistic underpinnings of these distinct subtypes has exploded. Converging preclinical rationales combined with early provocative clinical efficacy has focused recent attention on strategies targeting DNA repair defects for the treatment of patients with triple-negative and BRCA mutation-associated breast cancers. These developments are very promising and suggest that major advances in the targeted treatment of patients with triple-negative breast cancer are in sight. This review provides an overview of the clinical features of triple-negative breast cancer and current treatment strategies in the adjuvant setting. Mechanisms of DNA repair and the DNA damage response are reviewed to provide background for understanding novel approaches targeting DNA repair defects in this disease with DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors.

Thus far, detection of virus-derived miRNAs has been largely limited to DNA viruses, suggesting that RNA viruses may be unable to exploit this aspect of transcriptional regulation. Lack of RNA virus-produced miRNAs has been attributed to the replicative constraints that would incur following RNase III processing of a genomic hairpin. To ascertain whether the generation of viral miRNAs is limited to DNA viruses, we investigated whether influenza virus could be designed to deliver functional miRNAs without affecting replication. Here, we describe a modified influenza A virus that expresses cellular microRNA-124 (miR-124). Insertion of the miR-124 hairpin into an intron of the nuclear export protein transcript resulted in endogenous processing and functional miR-124. We demonstrate that a viral RNA genome incorporating a hairpin does not result in segment instability or miRNA-mediated genomic targeting, thereby permitting the virus to produce a miRNA without having a negative impact on viral replication.

One of the essential challenges hampering the construction of such systems is the need to precisely optimize protein expression levels for robust operation. However, it is difficult to design mRNA sequences for expression at targeted protein levels, since even a few nucleotide modifications around the start codon may alter translational efficiency and dramatically (up to 250-fold) change protein expression. Previous studies have used ad hoc approaches (e. g., random mutagenesis) to obtain the desired translational efficiencies for mRNA sequences. Hence, the development of a mathematical methodology capable of estimating translational efficiency would greatly facilitate the future design of mRNA sequences aimed at yielding desired protein expression levels. Results: We herein propose a mathematical model that focuses on translation initiation, which is the rate-limiting step in translation. The model uses mRNA-folding dynamics and ribosome-binding dynamics to estimate translational efficiencies solely from mRNA sequence information. We confirmed the feasibility of our model using previously reported expression data on the MS2 coat protein. For further confirmation, we used our model to design 22 luxR mRNA sequences predicted to have diverse translation efficiencies ranging from 10(-5) to 1. The expression levels of these sequences were measured in Escherichia coli and found to be highly correlated (R-2 = 0.87) with their estimated translational efficiencies. Moreover, we used our computational method to successfully transform a low-expressing DsRed2 mRNA sequence into a high-expressing mRNA sequence by maximizing its translational efficiency through the modification of only eight nucleotides upstream of the start codon. Conclusions: We herein describe a mathematical model that uses mRNA sequence information to estimate translational efficiency. This model could be used to design best-fit mRNA sequences having a desired protein expression level, thereby facilitating protein over-production in biotechnology or the protein expression-level optimization necessary for the construction of robust networks in synthetic biology."}},{"pk": "16433", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "5957", "pubYear": 2010, "doi": "", "sbw": 0, "title": "Metabolic P System Flux Regulation by Artificial Neural Networks", "pubMonth": "0", "journal": 16432, "abstract": "Metabolic P systems are an extension of P systems employed for modeling biochemical systems in a discrete and deterministic perspective.

The specific growth rate and glucose flux were found to be maximal at the wild-type level at which PGM had no flux control. Low flux control of PGM was found on mixed acid fluxes at highly reduced PGM activities. At the wild-type level PGM operated very far from V-max.

Enhanced metabolic capability for the synthesis of nucleotides, amino acids, lipids and other co-factors suggests that the common ancestor of the modern Chlamydiales may have been less dependent on their eukaryotic host. The fine-detailed analysis of biosynthetic pathways brings us closer to possibly developing a synthetic medium to grow W. chondrophila, a critical step in the development of genetic tools. As a whole, the availability of the W. chondrophila genome opens new possibilities in Chlamydiales research, providing new insights into the evolution of members of the order Chlamydiales and the biology of the Waddliaceae."}},{"pk": "16735", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "9", "pubYear": 2010, "doi": "10.1007/s11047-009-9158-4", "sbw": 0, "title": "Deterministic and stochastic P systems for modelling cellular processes", "pubMonth": "6", "journal": 16734, "abstract": "This paper presents two approaches based on metabolic and stochastic P systems, together with their associated analysis methods, for modelling biological systems and illustrates their use through two case studies."}},{"pk": "16760", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "7", "pubYear": 2010, "doi": "10.1166/jctn.2010.1474", "sbw": 0, "title": "Computational and Theoretical Materiomics: Properties of Biological and de novo Bioinspired Materials", "pubMonth": "7", "journal": 16759, "abstract": "Computational and theoretical efforts towards a quantitative understanding of biological as well as synthetic bioinspired and biomimetic materials (e.g., DNA, proteins, mineralized structures as well as soft tissues), their assembly, properties, and interaction with their environment has evolved into an active area of research at the interface of physical sciences and biology.

Results: We propose a new mechanism to generate developmental patterns and oscillations using a minimal number of genes. For this, we design a synthetic gene circuit with an antagonistic self-regulation to study the spatio-temporal control of protein expression. Here, we show that our minimal system can behave as a biological clock or memory, and it exhibites an inherent robustness due to a quorum sensing mechanism. We analyze this property by accounting for molecular noise in an heterogeneous population. We also show how the period of the oscillations is tunable by environmental signals, and we study the bifurcations of the system by constructing different phase diagrams.

We propose a novel automatic algorithm to estimate CCA diameter and IMT in ultrasound (US) images, based on separate analysis of anterior and posterior CCA walls and able to distinguish internal (intima-intima) and external (adventitia-adventitia) diameter. The method combines off-line signal-and image-processing techniques to accommodate echo images acquired at a frame rate of 30 Hz and composed directly from RF data, circumventing digital video-grabbing. Segmentation consists of automatic CCA recognition, followed by adventitial delineation performed with a sustain-attack filter with exponentially decaying reference functions. Intimal delineation is then based on the multiscale anisotropic barycenter (MAB), which is an extension of a known delineation method involving the \"first order absolute central moment\" of the echo amplitude. An automatic measure of the quality of the US beam incidence for each wall is superimosed on the CCA contour overlays for visual feedback. Validation is carried out on 36 US CCA acquisitions from 12 healthy volunteers, as well as on synthetic US images. Results indicate good accuracy on synthetic US images (within 1.3% for diameter and 3% for IMT). The in vivo intra-recording beat-to-beat variations are on average lower than 50 mm for external diameter and IMT, and lower than 100 mm for internal diameter. A comparison with a commercial device (ART. LAB system) shows that the proposed algorithm performs better in terms of inter-recording precision. The beam incidence control significantly improves the repeatability of IMT estimates, and motivates sonographers actively to maintain a proper scan plane throughout the acquisition to minimize the incidence of confounding factors. The method is clinically viable, providing robust estimates of CCA internal and external diameter and IMT waveforms for both CCA walls, even at a low B-mode update rate of 30 Hz (E-mail: peter. brands@esaote.nl and alessandro.rossi@bf.unimaas.nl) (C) 2010 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology."}},{"pk": "16893", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "36", "pubYear": 2010, "doi": "10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2010.02.007", "sbw": 0, "title": "IMPROVING THE ROBUSTNESS OF TIME-OF-FLIGHT BASED SHEAR WAVE SPEED RECONSTRUCTION METHODS USING RANSAC IN HUMAN LIVER IN VIVO", "pubMonth": "5", "journal": 16855, "abstract": "The stiffness of tissue can be quantified by measuring the shear wave speed (SWS) within the medium. Ultrasound is a real-time imaging modality capable of tracking the propagation of shear waves in soft tissue. Time-of-flight (TOF) methods have previously been shown to be effective for quantifying SWS from ultrasonically tracked displacements. However, the application of these methods to in vivo data is challenging due to the presence of additional sources of error, such as physiologic motion or spatial inhomogeneities in tissue. This article introduces the use of random sample consensus (RANSAC), a model fitting paradigm robust to the presence of gross outlier data, for estimating the SWS from ultrasonically tracked tissue displacements in vivo. SWS reconstruction is posed as a parameter estimation problem and the RANSAC solution to this problem is described. Simulations using synthetic TOF data show that RANSAC is capable of good stiffness reconstruction accuracy (mean error 0.5 kPa) and precision (standard deviation 0.6 kPa) over a range of shear stiffness (0.6-10 kPa) and proportion of inlier data (50%-95%). As with all TOF SWS estimation methods, the accuracy and precision of the RANSAC reconstructed shear modulus decreases with increasing tissue stiffness. The RANSAC SWS estimator was applied to radiation force induced shear wave data from 123 human patient livers acquired with a modified SONOLINE Antares ultrasound system (Siemens Healthcare, Ultrasound Business Unit, Mountain View, CA, USA) in a clinical setting before liver biopsy was performed. Stiffness measurements were not possible in 19 patients due to the absence of shear wave propagation inside the liver. The mean liver stiffness for the remaining 104 patients ranged from 1.3 to 24.2 kPa and the proportion of inliers for the successful reconstructions ranged between 42% to 99%. Using RANSAC for SWS estimation improved the diagnostic accuracy of liver stiffness for delineating fibrosis stage compared with ordinary least squares (OLS) without outlier removal (AUROC = 0.94 for F >= 3 and AUROC = 0.98 for F = 4). These results show that RANSAC is a suitable method for estimating the SWS from noisy in vivo shear wave displacements tracked by ultrasound.

In vivo, antioxidants decrease the concentration of free radicals but they are not only and not so much direct inhibitors of free radical processes as physiologically active compounds that prevent the formation of oxygen radicals and free radical oxidation. For example, synthetic antioxidant dibunol (BHT) prevents the generation of the O-2 (-) radical as a by-product of mitochondrial electron transport, while flavonoids exert a preventive antioxidant action by inducing the expression of the antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase and catalase.

Typically, only a fraction of the parameters (such as kinetic rate constants) are experimentally measured, while the rest are often fitted. The fitting process is usually based on experimental time course measurements of observables, which are used to assign parameter values that minimize some measure of the error between these measurements and the corresponding model prediction. The measurements, which can come from immunoblotting assays, fluorescent markers, etc., tend to be very noisy and taken at a limited number of time points. In this work we present a new approach to the problem of parameter selection of biological models. We show how one can use a dynamic recursive estimator, known as extended Kalman filter, to arrive at estimates of the model parameters. The proposed method follows. First, we use a variation of the Kalman filter that is particularly well suited to biological applications to obtain a first guess for the unknown parameters. Secondly, we employ an a posteriori identifiability test to check the reliability of the estimates. Finally, we solve an optimization problem to refine the first guess in case it should not be accurate enough. The final estimates are guaranteed to be statistically consistent with the measurements. Furthermore, we show how the same tools can be used to discriminate among alternate models of the same biological process. We demonstrate these ideas by applying our methods to two examples, namely a model of the heat shock response in E. coli, and a model of a synthetic gene regulation system.

Multicellular creatures maintain milieu interieur to keep an aqueous milieu intracellulair in order to transform the energy of nutrients into the form utilizable for driving cellular fife manifestations. Milieu interieur enables to integrate this kind of manifestations into fife manifestations of the whole multicellular creatures. The integration depends on a uniqueness and uniformity of the genome of cells, on their mutual recognition and adherence. The processes of ontogenetic development represent the natural mode of integration of cellular life manifestations. Functional systems of multicellular creatures are being established by organization of integrable cells using a wide range of developmental processes. Starting from the zygote division the new being displays all properties of a whole creature, although its life manifestations vary. Therefore, the whole organism is not only more than its parts, as supposed by holism, but also more than developmental stages of its life manifestations.

Kinetic studies demonstrated that these compounds are reversible competitive inhibitors. In this work we also carried out the analysis of the molecular recognition of these inhibitors on their macromolecular target, PtpA, through molecular modeling.

The nonlinear function describing the feedback regulation satisfies the sector condition, the time delays exist in both translation and feedback regulation processes, and the state-dependent Brownian motions are introduced to reflect the inherent intrinsic and extrinsic noise perturbations. The purpose of the addressed stability analysis problem is to establish some easy-to-verify conditions under which the dynamics of the true concentrations of the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein is asymptotically stable irrespective of the norm-bounded modeling errors. By utilizing a new Lyapunov functional based on the idea of \"delay fractioning\", we employ the linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique to derive delay-dependent sufficient conditions ensuring the robust stability of the gene regulatory networks.

This technology promises to provide a means to add many genes to a synthetic chromosome in sequential manner. An additional advantage is that the multiple transgenes will not be inserted into the normal chromosomes and thus will not exhibit linkage drag when converging the transgenes to different germplasm nor will they be mutagenic. Telomere truncation coupled with the introduction of site-specific recombination cassettes has proven to be an easy method to produce minichromosomes. Telomere truncation results from the transformation of plasmids carrying a block of telomere repeats at one end. Minichromosomes consisting of little more than a centromere have been produced for B chromosomes of maize. Such small chromosomes have been studied for their meiotic behavior, which differs from normal sized chromosomes in that homologue pairing is rare or nonexistent and sister chromatid cohesion fails at meiosis I. Potential modifications of the minichromosomes that can address these issues are discussed. Minichromosomes can be recovered from transformed plants that are polyploid or that carry an additional chromosome as the preferred target for truncation. Site-specific recombination has been demonstrated to operate on these terminally located sites. By introducing normal B chromosomes into lines with engineered mini-B chromosomes, the latter can be increased in copy number, which provides the potential to augment the expression of the introduced genes. Because the vast majority of plant species have the same telomere sequence, the truncating transgenes should be effective in most plants to generate engineered minichromosomes.

Increasing evidence suggests that cannabinoid 1 (CB1) receptor inhibition is beneficial in atherosclerosis and cardiovascular inflammation both in experimental models, as well as in humans. Here, we investigated the effects of CB1 receptor activation with the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) or synthetic agonist HU210 on cell death and interrelated signal transduction pathways in human primary coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs). Experimental approach: Cell death, CB1 receptor expression, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and activation of signal transduction pathways in HCAECs were determined by flow cytometry and molecular biology tools. Key results: In HCAECs expressing CB1 receptors (demonstrated by Western immunoblot and flow cytometry) AEA (5-15 mu M) or HU210 (30-1000 nM) triggered concentration- and time-dependent activation of p38 and c-Jun NH2-terminal protein kinase (JNK)-mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), cell death and ROS generation. The AEA- or HU210-induced cell death and MAPK activation were attenuated by CB1 antagonists [SR141716 (rimonabant) and AM281], inhibitors of p38 and JNK-MAPKs or the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. N-acetylcysteine alone prevented AEA- or HU210-induced ROS generation, but only partially attenuated MAPK activation and cell death. In contrast, in combination with CB1 antagonists, N-acetylcysteine completely prevented these effects. Conclusions and implications: CB1 receptor activation in endothelial cells may amplify the ROS-MAPK activation-cell death pathway in pathological conditions when the endocannabinoid synthetic or metabolic pathways are dysregulated by excessive inflammation and/or oxidative/nitrosative stress, thereby contributing to the development of endothelial dysfunction and pathophysiology of multiple cardiovascular diseases.

There have been recent attempts to improve the rate and specificity of Rubisco, the carboxylating enzyme operating in the Calvin-Benson cycle, however, they have achieved only limited success. Nature employs several alternative carbon fixation pathways, which prompted us to ask whether more efficient novel synthetic cycles could be devised. Using the entire repertoire of approximately 5,000 metabolic enzymes known to occur in nature, we computationally identified alternative carbon fixation pathways that combine existing metabolic building blocks from various organisms. We compared the natural and synthetic pathways based on physicochemical criteria that include kinetics, energetics, and topology. Our study suggests that some of the proposed synthetic pathways could have significant quantitative advantages over their natural counterparts, such as the overall kinetic rate. One such cycle, which is predicted to be two to three times faster than the Calvin-Benson cycle, employs the most effective carboxylating enzyme, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, using the core of the naturally evolved C4 cycle.

Accordingly, the mutations obey a simple 'similar replaces similar' rule as disruption of the resulting protein structure is minimized by the modest alterations in the amino acid side chains. At laboratory level such non-destructive modifications have to be incorporated in a controlled manner by integrating the chemical diversity achieved in synthetic chemistry into proteins. For this purpose the most straightforward route is generation of the synthetic proteins by the cellular translational apparatus via insertion of isosteric synthetic amino acid analogs during gene expression. This leads to target proteins with chemical diversity not found in nature. Such genetic code engineering does not require any DNA mutagenesis step as it produces extensive sequence variations at the level of protein translation. It is generally achieved either by expansion of the existing amino acid repertoire or by introduction of novel coding units. Here we highlight the concept of using isosteric noncanonical amino acid analogs analogs for in vivo protein synthesis as a useful tool to dissect, study and manipulate protein folding and conformational stability with two examples, the prion protein and green fluorescent protein. In the first example, we show how alternative translation of the single gene sequence by different synthetic amino acids enables the protein to fold into stable, but differing conformations. In particular, replacement of methionine by the isosteric analogs norleucine/metoxinine provide a chemical model to dissect the role of hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity in the a alpha --> beta conversion of the prion protein structure. In the second example, proline residues in green fluorescent protein are replaced with (4S)-fluoroproline which improves folding and overall stability of the protein.

Methodology/Principal Findings: The proteomic profiles of cells growing in media in which the proteins were expressed to high or low levels suggested a limitation in the availability of branched-chain amino acids, more specifically a too limited capacity to accumulate these nutrients. By supplying the cells with an alternative path for accumulation of Ile, Leu and/or Val, i.e., a medium supplement of the appropriate dipeptides, or by engineering the transport capacity for branched-chain amino acids, the expression levels could be increased several fold.

Using microarray technology, it is possible to extract measurements of thousands of genes into a single analysis step having a picture of the cell gene expression. Several methods have been developed to infer gene networks from steady-state data, much less literature is produced about time-course data, so the development of algorithms to infer gene networks from time-series measurements is a current challenge into bioinformatics research area. In order to detect dependencies between genes at different time delays, we propose an approach to infer gene regulatory networks from time-series measurements starting from a well known algorithm based on information theory. Results: In this paper we show how the ARACNE (Algorithm for the Reconstruction of Accurate Cellular Networks) algorithm can be used for gene regulatory network inference in the case of time-course expression profiles. The resulting method is called TimeDelay-ARACNE. It just tries to extract dependencies between two genes at different time delays, providing a measure of these dependencies in terms of mutual information. The basic idea of the proposed algorithm is to detect time-delayed dependencies between the expression profiles by assuming as underlying probabilistic model a stationary Markov Random Field. Less informative dependencies are filtered out using an auto calculated threshold, retaining most reliable connections. TimeDelay-ARACNE can infer small local networks of time regulated gene-gene interactions detecting their versus and also discovering cyclic interactions also when only a medium-small number of measurements are available. We test the algorithm both on synthetic networks and on microarray expression profiles. Microarray measurements concern S. cerevisiae cell cycle, E. coli SOS pathways and a recently developed network for in vivo assessment of reverse engineering algorithms. Our results are compared with ARACNE itself and with the ones of two previously published algorithms: Dynamic Bayesian Networks and systems of ODEs, showing that TimeDelay-ARACNE has good accuracy, recall and F-score for the network reconstruction task. Conclusions: Here we report the adaptation of the ARACNE algorithm to infer gene regulatory networks from time-course data, so that, the resulting network is represented as a directed graph. The proposed algorithm is expected to be useful in reconstruction of small biological directed networks from time course data."}},{"pk": "18234", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "89", "pubYear": 2010, "doi": "10.1002/bdrb.20243", "sbw": 0, "title": "Peri- and Postnatal Rodent Development of Hematide, an Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agent", "pubMonth": "4", "journal": 18233, "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Aperi- and postnatal reproduction toxicity study was conducted in rats treated with Hematide, a synthetic PEGylated peptidic erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA). METHODS: Hematide, at IV doses of 0, 0.5, 3, and 15 mg/kg, was administered from implantation through lactation on gestation days (GDs) 5 and 18 and lactation day (LD) 13. RESULTS: Hematide induced pronounced polycythemia in all Hematide-treated dams. On LDs 2 and 21, hemoglobin (Hgb) increases above control levels were 3.1, 5.2, and 5.0 g/dL and 4.1, 5.1, and 5.5 g/dL at the 0.5, 3, and 15 mg/kg/dose, respectively. There were no effects on parturition, lactation, or maternal behavior in the F0 generation female rats. A slight decrease in pup viability on postpartum days 2-4 and lower body weights and/or body weight gain for the F1 generation were associated with pronounced polycythemia and decreases in maternal body weight gain and/or food consumption at 3 mg/kg/dose. Hematide fetal exposure was negligible. No Hematide effect, other than on growth and survival, was noted on developmental, functional, mating, and fertility end points in the F1 generation rats, and no effect on litter or fetal parameters was observed in the F2 generation. The maternal no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for Hematide was 0.5 mg/kg, and the NOAEL for parturition and maternal behavior was 15 mg/kg. The NOAEL for F1 pup viability and growth was 0.5 mg/kg/dose. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the Hematide-associated adverse findings were attributed to exaggerated erythropoiesis (pronounced and prolonged polycythemia) resulting from administration of an ESA to pregnant animals.

DNQ was synthesized in seven linear steps through a route employing three palladium-mediated coupling reactions. Experiments performed on cancer cells grown in hypoxia and normoxia strongly suggest that DNQ undergoes bioreduction to its semiquinone, which then is re-oxidized by molecular oxygen, forming superoxide that induces cell death. Furthermore, global transcript profiling of cells treated with DNQ shows elevation of transcripts related to oxidative stress, a result confirmed at the protein level by Western blotting. In contrast to most other antineoplastic agents that generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNQ potently induces death of cancer cells in culture, with IC50 values between 16 and 210 nM. In addition, unlike the experimental therapeutic elesclomol, DNQ is still able to induce cancer cell death under hypoxic conditions.

Both synthetic folic acid and the most biologically abundant extracellular reduced folate, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, are degraded under conditions of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure. Skin is a proliferative tissue with increased folate nutrient demands due to a dependence upon continuous epidermal cell proliferation and differentiation to maintain homeostasis. Regions of skin are also chronically exposed to UVR. which penetrates to the actively dividing basal layer of the epidermis, increasing the folate nutrient demands in order to replace folate species degraded by UVR exposure and to supply the folate cofactors required for repair of photo-damaged DNA. Localized folate deficiencies of skin are a likely consequence of UVR exposure. We report here a cultured keratinocyte model of folate deficiency that has been applied to examine possible effects of folate nutritional deficiencies in skin. Utilizing this model, we were able to quantify the concentrations of key intracellular folate species during folate depletion and repletion. We investigated the hypotheses that the genomic instability observed under conditions of folate deficiency in other cell types extends to skin, adversely effecting cellular capacity to handle UVR insult and that optimizing folate levels in skin is beneficial in preventing or repairing the pro-carcinogenic effects of UVR exposure. Folate restriction leads to rapid depletion of intracellular reduced folates resulting in S-phase growth arrest, increased levels of inherent DNA damage, and increased uracil misincorporation into DNA, without a significant losses in overall cellular viability. Folate depleted keratinocytes were sensitized toward UVR induced apoptosis and displayed a diminished capacity to remove DNA breaks resulting from both photo and oxidative DNA damage. Thus, folate deficiency creates a permissive environment for genomic instability, an early event in the process of skin carcinogenesis. The effects of folate restriction, even in severely depleted, growth-arrested keratinocytes, were reversible by repletion with folic acid. Overall, these results indicate that skin health can be positively influenced by optimal folate nutriture. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The specificity of the effects of BMS-470539 was assessed using mice bearing mutant inactive MC1 receptors (the recessive yellow e/e colony). Key results: BMS-470539, given before an ischaemia-reperfusion protocol, inhibited cell adhesion and emigration with no effect on cell rolling, as assessed 90 min into the reperfusion phase. These properties were paralleled by inhibition of tissue expression of both CXCL1 and CCL2.

Labeled VISA could be relocalized from the PEG-rich into the dextran-rich phase domain by increasing the pH from 4.1 to 6.5 to renature the protein. This approach to controlling protein localization does not require extensive reorganization of the vesicle interior: coexisting PEG-rich and dextran-rich compartments are maintained throughout the experiments. It is also quite general, we demonstrated that several other proteins varying in size and isoelectric point also relocalized within compartmentalized artificial cells in response to external pH change. This work presents stimulus-responsive protein relocalization between compartments in an artificial cell, such experimental models can provide a framework for investigating the consequences of protein localization in cell biology."}},{"pk": "18596", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "49", "pubYear": 2010, "doi": "10.1021/ic901891n", "sbw": 0, "title": "Oxygen Activation at Mononuclear Nonheme Iron Centers: A Superoxo Perspective", "pubMonth": "4", "journal": 15793, "abstract": "Dioxygen (O-2) activation by iron enzymes is responsible for many metabolically important transformations in biology.

In many applications, count numbers of the diffusing molecular species are very low, leading to the need to explicitly model the inherent variability using stochastic methods. Despite their importance and frequent use, parameter estimation for both deterministic and stochastic reaction-diffusion systems is still a challenging problem. Results: We present a Bayesian inference approach to solve both the parameter and state estimation problem for stochastic reaction-diffusion systems. This allows a determination of the full posterior distribution of the parameters (expected values and uncertainty). We benchmark the method by illustrating it on a simple synthetic experiment. We then test the method on real data about the diffusion of the morphogen Bicoid in Drosophila melanogaster. The results show how the precision with which parameters can be inferred varies dramatically, indicating that the ability to infer full posterior distributions on the parameters can have important experimental design consequences. Conclusions: The results obtained demonstrate the feasibility and potential advantages of applying a Bayesian approach to parameter estimation in stochastic reaction-diffusion systems. In particular, the ability to estimate credibility intervals associated with parameter estimates can be precious for experimental design. Further work, however, will be needed to ensure the method can scale up to larger problems."}},{"pk": "18657", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "16", "pubYear": 2010, "doi": "10.1089/ten.teb.2009.0496", "sbw": 0, "title": "Facial Reconstruction by Biosurgery: Cell Transplantation Versus Cell Homing", "pubMonth": "4", "journal": 2906, "abstract": "The face distinguishes one human being from another. When the face is disfigured because of trauma, tumor removal, congenital anomalies, or chronic diseases, the patient has a strong desire for functional and esthetic restoration. Current practice of facial reconstruction using autologous grafts, synthetic fillers, and prostheses is frequently below the surgeon's and patient's expectations. Facial reconstruction is yet to take advantage of recent advances in seemingly unrelated fields of stem cell biology, chemical engineering, biomaterials, and tissue engineering. \"Biosurgery,'' a new concept that we propose, will incorporate novel principles and strategies of bioactive cues, biopolymers, and/or cells to restore facial defects. Small facial defects can likely be reconstructed by cell homing and without cell transplantation. A critical advantage of cell homing is that agilely recruited endogenous cells have the potential to harness the host's innate capacity for regeneration, thus accelerating the rate of regulatory and commercialization processes for product development. Large facial defects, however, may not be restorable without cell delivery per our understanding at this time. New breakthrough in biosurgery will likely originate from integrated strategies of cell biology, cytokine biology, chemical engineering, biomaterials, and tissue engineering. Regardless of cell homing or cell delivery approaches, biosurgery not only will minimize surgical trauma and repetitive procedures, but also produce long-lasting results. At the same time, caution must be exercised against the development of products that lack scientific basis or dogmatic combination of cells, biomaterials, and biomolecules.

Although SB could assist in addressing pressing global challenges, such as sustainable and renewable energy, there are considerable societal concerns that accompany its development and applications. This article is designed to anticipate and prepare for these concerns by identifying policy problems associated with SB oversight, upstream of its development. Projected applications of SB are reviewed and a typology of them is developed. Key oversight policy problems are then identified based on historical experiences with other emerging technologies, such as nanotechnology and biotechnology. Problems associated with biosecurity, biosafety, intellectual property, and ethics are discussed in relation to the typology of SB applications to identify applications of the highest potential concern. Finally, policy options for SB oversight are considered, preventative to promotional. We propose that different categories of SB application may warrant different oversight regimes: there might not be an appropriate \"one size fits all\" approach. We stop short of making specific recommendations, but suggest that the typology, problems, and oversight options identified in this article be used as a starting point for deliberative, democratic decisionmaking processes that take into account a wide range of perspectives about risk, economic impact, scientific progress, and moral reasoning in the design of oversight systems."}},{"pk": "18709", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "8", "pubYear": 2010, "doi": "10.1039/b923331h", "sbw": 0, "title": "The use of click chemistry in the emerging field of catalomics", "pubMonth": "0", "journal": 2776, "abstract": "Of the thousands of known chemical reactions, a handful of reactions, called \"click\" reactions, stand out with features such as good chemoselectivity, good solvent compatibilities, modularity, minimum synthetic demands, bioorthogonality and high yields.

Bioactive PEG-based gels have largely relied on heterobifunctional or multi-arm PEG precursors that can be difficult to synthesize and characterize or expensive to obtain. Here, we report an alternative strategy, which instead uses inexpensive and readily available PEG precursors to simplify reactant sourcing. This new approach provides a robust system in which to probe cellular interactions with the microenvironment. We used the step-growth polymerization of PEG diacrylate (PEGDA, 3400 Da) with bis-cysteine matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-sensitive peptides via Michael-type addition to form biodegradable photoactive macromers of the form acrylate-PEG-(peptide-PEG)m-acrylate. The molecular weight (MW) of these macromers is controlled by the stoichiometry of the reaction, with a high proportion of resultant macromer species greater than 500 kDa. In addition, the polydispersity of these materials was nearly identical for three different MMP-sensitive peptide sequences subjected to the same reaction conditions. When photopolymerized into hydrogels, these high MW materials exhibit increased swelling and sensitivity to collagenase-mediated degradation as compared to previously published PEG hydrogel systems. Cell-adhesive acrylate-PEG-CGRGDS was synthesized similarly and its immobilization and stability in solid hydrogels was characterized with a modified Lowry assay. To illustrate the functional utility of this approach in a biological setting, we applied this system to develop materials that promote angiogenesis in an ex vivo aortic arch explant assay. We demonstrate the formation and invasion of new sprouts mediated by endothelial cells into the hydrogels from embedded embryonic chick aortic arches. Furthermore, we show that this capillary sprouting and three-dimensional migration of endothelial cells can be tuned by engineering the MMP-susceptibility of the hydrogels and the presence of functional immobilized adhesive ligands (CGRGDS vs. CGRGES peptide). The facile chemistry described and significant cellular responses observed suggest the usefulness of these materials in a variety of in vitro and ex vivo biologic investigations, and may aid in the design or refinement of material systems for a range of tissue engineering approaches.

Here we show a new strategy for the enhancement of biogas production from hemicellulose-rich substrates. Hemicellulolytic populations from a common biogas fermenter consortium were successively enriched in batch-cultures using a synthetic medium containing xylan powder as single carbon source under anaerobic mesophilic conditions. Enriched hemicellulolytic bacteria were immobilised on trace metal activated zeolite to ensure a stable storage and easy application.

Specific enrichment of hemicellulolytic bacteria during the process was confirmed by using single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis based on amplification of the eubacterial 16S rDNA fragments.

Just as important as quantitation of biomolecules has been the creation of approaches that uncover the regulatory and signaling connections between biomolecules. Our specific interest is in understanding peptide metabolism in a physiological setting, and this has led us to develop a multidisciplinary approach that integrates genetics, analytical chemistry, synthetic chemistry, biochemistry, and chemical biology to identify the substrates of peptidases in vivo. To accomplish this we utilize a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based peptidomics platform to measure changes in the peptidome as a function of peptidase activity. Previous analysis of mice lacking the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4(-/-) mice), a biomedically relevant peptidase, using this approach identified a handful of novel endogenous DPP4 substrates. Here, we utilize these substrates and tissues from DPP4(-/-) mice to improve the coverage of the peptidomics platform by optimizing the key steps in the workflow, and in doing so, discover over 70 renal DPP4 substrates (up from 7 at the beginning of our optimization), a 10-fold improvement in our coverage. The sequences of these DPP4 peptide substrates support a broad role for DPP4 in proline-containing peptide catabolism and strengthen a biochemical model that interlinks aminopeptidase and DPP4 activities. Moreover, the improved peptidome coverage also led to the detection of greater numbers of known bioactive peptides (e.g., peptide hormones) during the analysis of gut samples, suggesting additional uses for this optimized workflow.

Therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing cholesterol plasma levels have shown efficacy in either reducing progression of atherosclerotic plaques and atherosclerosis-related mortality. The farnesoid-X-receptor (FXR) is a member of metabolic nuclear receptors (NRs) superfamily activated by bile acids. In entero-hepatic tissues, FXR functions as a bile acid sensor regulating bile acid synthesis, detoxification and excretion. In the liver FXR induces the expression of an atypical NR, the small heterodimer partner, which subsequently inhibits the activity of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha repressing the transcription of cholesterol 7a-hydroxylase, the critical regulatory gene in bile acid synthesis. In the intestine FXR induces the release of fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15) (or FGF19 in human), which activates hepatic FGF receptor 4 (FGFR4) signalling to inhibit bile acid synthesis. In rodents, FXR activation decreases bile acid synthesis and lipogenesis and increases lipoprotein clearance, and regulates glucose homeostasis by reducing liver gluconeogenesis.

NSPs are proteins expressed from the virus genome in the infected cell, but are not incorporated into the mature virus particle. NSPs play an essential role in virus replication, morphogenesis and pathogenesis, and most of them exhibit multifunctional properties. Structure-function analysis of the NSPs is essential for understanding the molecular mechanisms by which the virus circumvents host innate immune responses, inhibits cellular protein synthesis, hijacks the protein synthetic machinery for its own propagation and manifests the disease process. Because of their essential roles in virus biology, NSPs represent potential targets for the development of antiviral agents. Determination of the three-dimensional structure of NSPs has been hindered due to low-level expression and aggregation. To date, the complete three-dimensional structure of only NSP2 has been determined. The structures of the N- and C-terminal domains of NSP3 and the diarrhoea-inducing domain of NSP4 have also been determined.

A number of organic bridge-bonded functional and multifunctional PMOs with inorganic-organic hybridized framework have been synthesized from varieties of precursors. The syntheses of a series of PMOs have been accomplished typically by resorting to the co-condensation of the mixed precursors of tetraalkoxysilane and bridged organosiloxane, bridged organosiloxane with terminal organosiloxane, or the co-condensation of multiple bridged organosiloxane. The choice of precursors depends on the desired location of organic groups which can be either on the surface or within the pore wall in resulting PMOs. Besides precursors, synthesis conditions evidently play an important role in the formation, morphologies and pore structure of PMOs. Recent advances show that the morphologies and mesopores of PMOs can be adjusted by changing the synthetic parameters such as template, additives, pH value, and temperature.

LXR agonist treatment enhanced both basal and stimulated insulin secretion, which corresponded to an increase in the expression of genes involved in anaplerosis and reverse cholesterol transport. Furthermore, enzyme activity of pyruvate carboxylase, a key regulator of pyruvate cycling and anaplerotic flux, was also increased. Whereas LXR agonist treatment up-regulated known downstream targets involved in lipogenesis, we observed no increase in the accumulation of intra-islet triglyceride at the dose of agonist used in our study.

The first generation employed spontaneous NCA polycondensation in water without a macroinitiator, this afforded low-molecular-weight, linear poly(L-lysine) G1 with a polymerisation degree of 8 and a polydispersity index of 1.2. The spontaneous precipitation of the growing N-epsilon-Tfa-protected polymer (GnP) ensures moderate control of the molecular weight (with unimodal distribution) and easy work-up. The subsequent alkaline removal of Tfa protecting groups afforded generation Gn of DGL as a free form (with 35-60% overall yield from NCA precursor, depending on the DGL generation) that was either used directly in the synthesis of the next generation (G(n+1)) or collected for other uses. Unprotected forms of DGL G1-G5 were characterised by size-exclusion chromatography, capillary electrophoresis and H-1 NMR spectroscopy. The latter technique allowed us to assess the branching density of DGL, the degree of which (ca. 25%) turned out to be intermediate between previously described dendritic graft poly(L-lysines) and lysine dendrimers. An optimised monomer (NCA) versus macroinitiator (DGL G(n-1)) ratio allowed Lis to obtain unimodal molecular weight distributions with polydispersity indexes ranging from 1.3 to 1.5. Together with the possibility of reaching high molecular weights (with a polymerisation degree of ca. 1000 for G5) within a few synthetic steps, this synthetic route to DGL provides an easy, cost-efficient, multigram-scale access to dendritic polylysines with various potential applications in biology and in other domains."}},{"pk": "19497", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "8", "pubYear": 2010, "doi": "10.1089/bsp.2009.0024", "sbw": 0, "title": "BIOINFORMATICS FOR BIODEFENSE: CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES", "pubMonth": "3", "journal": 19496, "abstract": "The intentional release of traditional or combinatorial bioweapons remains one of the most important challenges that will continue to shape homeland security.

These materials are generally optimized for their function through precise control over the structure, size, shape, and assembly of the component parts and can be superior to many synthetic materials. The shapes and forms of minerals encountered in nature strongly contrast with those that are generally formed in a synthetic environment. According to current understanding, this is achieved through different modes of control: their shape can be controlled by restricting their growth to a confined space or by influencing their preferred direction of growth, in addition, for crystalline materials, polymorph selection and oriented nucleation are achieved through specific interactions between a template or additive and the developing nucleus. Also, controlled arrangement of nanoparticles into superstructures can lead to a complex structure. The understanding and, ultimately, the mimicking of these processes will provide new synthetic routes to specialized organic-inorganic hybrid materials.

Additionally, all nAChR-mediated cochlear activity is lost, as characterized by a failure of the descending efferent system to suppress cochlear responses to sound. In an effort to characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying the structural and functional consequences following loss of alpha 9 subunit expression, we performed whole-transcriptome gene expression analyses on cochleae of wild type and alpha 9 knockout (alpha 9(-/-)) mice during postnatal days spanning critical periods of synapse formation and maturation. Principal Findings: Data revealed that loss of alpha 9 receptor subunit expression leads to an up-regulation of genes involved in synaptic transmission and ion channel activity. Unexpectedly, loss of alpha 9 receptor subunit expression also resulted in an increased expression of genes encoding GABA receptor subunits and the GABA synthetic enzyme, glutamic acid decarboxylase. These data suggest the existence of a previously unrecognized association between the nicotinic cholinergic and GABAergic systems in the cochlea. Computational analyses have highlighted differential expression of several gene sets upon loss of nicotinic cholinergic activity in the cochlea. Time-series analysis of whole transcriptome patterns, represented as self-organizing maps, revealed a disparate pattern of gene expression between alpha 9(-/-) and wild type cochleae at the onset of hearing (P13), with knockout samples resembling immature postnatal ages. Conclusions: We have taken a systems biology approach to provide insight into molecular programs influenced by the loss of nicotinic receptor-based cholinergic activity in the cochlea and to identify candidate genes that may be involved in nicotinic cholinergic synapse formation, stabilization or function within the inner ear.

Future research on Collimonas is expected to take advantage of the genomic tools and resources that are becoming available to uncover and describe the genes and gene functions that distinguish this group of bacteria and are the basis for its phenotypes. Potential applications of collimonads include the control of unwanted fungi, for example in agriculture, their use as biological indicators of soil quality and fertility, and as a source of bioactive compounds."}},{"pk": "19950", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "7", "pubYear": 2010, "doi": "", "sbw": 0, "title": "Nucleic Acids with a Six-Membered 'Carbohydrate' Mimic in the Backbone", "pubMonth": "0", "journal": 9436, "abstract": "Starting from pyranose nucleic acids, several series of modified nucleic acids with a six-membered carbohydrate moiety (mimic) have been synthesized and analyzed over a period of 20 years, and this work is summarized here.

Fibrin, widely used as a surgical sealant, is one such matrix that may be augmented by the addition of protein factors to promote cell infiltration and differentiation. The thrombin-catalyzed conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin exposes N-terminal fibrin knobs that bind to C-terminal pockets to form the fibrin network. Here, we have created a platform system for the production of therapeutic proteins that capitalize on these native knob:pocket interactions for protein delivery within fibrin matrices. This system enables the retention of therapeutic proteins within fibrin without additional enzymatic or synthetic crosslinking factors. Using an integrin-binding fibronectin fragment as a model protein, we demonstrate that engineered knob-protein fusions bind consistently and specifically to fibrin(ogen). Equilibrium dissociation constants (K-D) obtained using surface plasmon resonance indicate that these fusions have pm binding affinities, comparable to the native knob-containing fibrin fragments. The specificity of these interactions was verified by ELISA in the presence of molar excess of competing knob mimics. Release profiles and real-time confocal imaging demonstrate that the fusions were retained within fibrin matrices, even under the stringent continuous perfusion conditions used in the latter. In summary, this work explores the benefits and limitations of engaging native, biologically-inspired, non-covalent knob:pocket interactions within fibrin(ogen) for the retention of therapeutic proteins in fibrin matrices and provides insight into the stability of native knob:pocket interactions within fibrin networks.

However traditional clustering algorithms have limitations since they can not identify the substructures of samples and features hidden behind the data. Different from clustering, biclustering is a new methodology for discovering genes that are highly related to a subset of samples. Several biclustering models/methods have been presented and used for tumor clinical diagnosis and pathological research. In this paper, we present a new biclustering model using Binary Matrix Factorization (BMF). BMF is a new variant rooted from non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). We begin by proving a new boundedness property of NMF. Two different algorithms to implement the model and their comparison are then presented. We show that the microarray data biclustering problem can be formulated as a BMF problem and can be solved effectively using our proposed algorithms. Unlike the greedy strategy-based algorithms, our proposed algorithms for BMF are more likely to find the global optima. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the advantages of BMF over existing biclustering methods. Besides the attractive clustering performance, BMF can generate sparse results (i.e., the number of genes/features involved in each biclustering structure is very small related to the total number of genes/features) that are in accordance with the common practice in molecular biology."}},{"pk": "20267", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "222", "pubYear": 2010, "doi": "10.1002/jcp.21960", "sbw": 0, "title": "Dexamethasone Counteracts the Anti-Osteoclastic, But Not the Anti-Leukemic, Activity of TNF-Related Aeoptosis Inducing Ligand (TRAIL)", "pubMonth": "2", "journal": 20266, "abstract": "We have analyzed the effect of the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone, used alone or in combination with recombinant TRAIL, on in vitro osteoclastic differentiation of peripheral blood-derived macrophages cultured in the presence of macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) + RANKL for 12-14 days. Dexamethasone exhibited different effects based on the concentration used. Indeed, while at 10(-7) M dexamethasone reduced the number of mature osteoclasts, at 10(-8) M showed no significant effects and at 10(-9) M significantly increased the number of mature osteoclasts, with respect to cells cultured with only M-CSF + RANKL. On the other hand, the addition in culture of recombinant TRAIL inhibited the output of mature osteoclasts induced by M-CSF + RANKL. However, the presence of dexamethasone (10(-8) or 10(-9) M) into the culture medium significantly counteracted the anti-osteoclastic activity of TRAIL. In order to ascertain whether dexamethasone, might also interfere with the anti-leukemic activity of TRAIL, the degree of apoptosis induced by TRAIL was evaluated in several myeloid (OCI, MOLM, HL-60) and lymphoid (SKW6.4, MAVER, BJAB) leukemic cell lines. The levels of TRAIL-triggered apoptosis were not significantly different between leukemic cells cultured in the absence or presence of dexamethasone. Concerning the molecular mechanism mediating the dexamethasone-suppression of the TRAIL activity in pre-osteoclasts, but not in leukemic cells, we found that dexamethasone induced a significant down-regulation of the surface levels of TRAIL-R2 in cells of the osteoclastic lineage but not in leukemic cells. The ability of dexamethasone to counteract the TRAIL pathway envisions a novel mechanism mediating the pro-osteoclastic activity of dexamethasone in vivo. J. Cell. Physiol. 222: 357-364, 2010.

From the mouse microglia cell-based assays, an imidazo [4,5-b] pyridine compound KR-31360 was identified as an inhibitor of microglial NO production with an IC50 value of 2 mu M. Structure-activity relationship study indicated that 5-position of imidazo [4,5-b] pyridine ring is critical for the activity. KR-31360 also inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and transcription of TNF-alpha, interleukin-1 beta, and inducible nitric oxide synthase as well as activation of nuclear factor kappa B and mitogen-activated protein kinases.

The neuroprotective activity of the compound was most effective when microglia were pretreated with the compound prior to LPS challenge.

One hundred and twenty-three distinct metabolites were identified while approximately 1900 peaks from the B6000 observed were assigned.

We examined the metabolome of S. pombe cells exponentially grown in synthetic culture medium (EMM2) at two different temperatures, 26 degrees C and 36 degrees C.

In this study, we develop a novel computationally efficient method to identify feedback loops embedded in intracellular networks, which uses only time-series experimental data and requires no knowledge of the network structure. In the proposed approach, a non-parametric system identification technique, as well as a spectral factor analysis, is applied to derive a graphical criterion based on non-causal components of the system's impulse response. The appearance of non-causal components in the impulse response sequences arising from stochastic output perturbations is shown to imply the presence of underlying feedback connections within a linear network. In order to extend the approach to nonlinear networks, we linearize the intracellular networks about an equilibrium point, and then choose the magnitude of the output perturbations sufficiently small so that the resulting time-series responses remain close to the chosen equilibrium point. In this way, the impulse response sequences of the linearized system can be used to determine the presence or absence of feedback loops in the corresponding nonlinear network. The proposed method utilizes the time profile data from intracellular perturbation experiments and only requires the perturbability of output nodes. Most importantly, the method does not require any a priori knowledge of the system structure. For these reasons, the proposed approach is very well suited to identifying feedback loops in large-scale bio-molecular networks. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated via two examples: a synthetic network model with a negative feedback loop and a nonlinear caspase function model of apoptosis with a positive feedback loop."}},{"pk": "20662", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "6", "pubYear": 2010, "doi": "10.1038/NCHEMBIO.273", "sbw": 2, "title": "Synthetic translational regulation by an L7Ae-kink-turn RNP switch", "pubMonth": "1", "journal": 2665, "abstract": "The regulation of cell signaling pathways and the reconstruction of genetic circuits are important aspects of bioengineering research.
