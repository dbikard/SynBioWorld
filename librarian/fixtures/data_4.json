Such efforts, inspired in the standard design of electronic circuits(4-7), are limited by the difficulties arising from wiring the basic computational units (logic gates) through the appropriate connections, each one to be implemented by a different molecule. Here, we show that there is a logically different form of implementing complex Boolean logic computations that reduces wiring constraints thanks to a redundant distribution of the desired output among engineered cells. A practical implementation is presented using a library of engineered yeast cells, which can be combined in multiple ways. Each construct defines a logic function and combining cells and their connections allow building more complex synthetic devices. As a proof of principle, we have implemented many logic functions by using just a few engineered cells. Of note, small modifications and combination of those cells allowed for implementing more complex circuits such as a multiplexer or a 1-bit adder with carry, showing the great potential for re-utilization of small parts of the circuit. Our results support the approach of using cellular consortia as an efficient way of engineering complex tasks not easily solvable using single-cell implementations."}},{"pk": "300", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "45", "pubYear": 2010, "doi": "10.1016/j.procbio.2010.03.017", "sbw": 1, "title": "Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase from a hyper-thermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima: Characterization, metabolite stability, and its implications", "pubMonth": "12", "journal": 299, "abstract": "Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase gene from a hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima was cloned, and the recombinant protein was produced in E. coil, purified, and characterized. The fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) with a molecular mass of ca. 28 kDa was purified from the fusion protein cellulose-binding module (CBM)-intein-FBPase by affinity adsorption on regenerated amorphous cellulose followed by intein self-cleavage. The substrate fructose 1,6-bisphosphate was not stable at high temperatures, especially at high pHs. The degradation constants of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, glucose-6-phosphate, and fructose-6-phosphate were determined at different temperatures (37, 60, and 80 degrees C) and pH 7.5 or 9.0. The k(cat) and K-m values of FBPase were 8.57 s(-1) and 0.04 mM at 60 degrees C, as well as 58.7 s(-1) and 0.12 mM at 80 degrees C. This enzyme was very stable at its suboptimal temperatures, with half-life times of ca. 1330 and 55.6h at 60 and 80 degrees C, respectively. At 60 degrees C, this enzyme had an estimated total turn-over number of 20,500,000 (mol product/mol enzyme) and weight-based total turn-over umber of 192,000 (kg product/kg enzyme), respectively. These results indicated that this enzyme would be a stable building block for cell-free synthetic pathway biotransformation (SyPaB) that can implement complicated biochemical reactions. In order to obtain high-yield desired products, we suggest that over-addition or over-expression of the enzymes responsible for converting easily degraded metabolites should be important to prevent unnecessary metabolite loss for in vitro or in vivo synthetic pathway design.

Photosynthetic biofuel production represents one of these since for this, one uses renewable resources. Sunlight is used for the conversion of water and CO2 into biomass. Two strategies are used in parallel: plant-based production via sugar fermentation into ethanol and biodiesel production through transesterification. Both, however, exacerbate other problems, including regional nutrient balancing and the world's food supply, and suffer from the modest efficiency of photosynthesis. Maximizing the efficiency of natural and engineered photosynthesis is therefore of utmost importance. Algal photosynthesis is the system of choice for this particularly for energy applications. Complete conversion of CO2 into biomass is not necessary for this. Innovative methods of synthetic biology allow one to combine photosynthetic and fermentative metabolism via the so-called Photanol approach to form biofuel directly from Calvin cycle intermediates through use of the naturally transformable cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp.

Although existing accounts of genomics and biotechnology contend that species differences and evolutionary histories have undergone 'flattening' by molecular techniques and concepts, analysis of design practices in synthetic biology suggests that vertical aggregations of biological technique, substance and work are occurring. This article analyses the movement of design processes into biology by examining software, diagrams and forms of collaboration intersecting in the production of biological constructs such as metabolic pathways, minimal genomes and biological standard parts. In characterising the design processes taking shape in synthetic biology, it develops the concepts of 'meta-technique' and 'meta-material'. The notion of design as a meta-technique shows how synthetic biology assembles techniques and renders them available via practices of collaboration and standardisation. The notion of meta-material suggests ways of thinking about the dynamism of living things infused by models, constructs and layered work-processes. The practical re-deployment of biological techniques we see in the design software, the development of increasingly extensive and interlinked biological constructs assembled by design, and the shifting enrolments of biological work associated with design as a decoupled work process alter what counts as biological work and what counts as biological substance. The increasing salience of biological design has significant implications for how we conceptualise participation in biotechnology and biomedicine more generally.

It therefore challenges the creation, updating, and re-use of biochemical models. Here, we propose a rule-based modelling framework that exploits the intrinsic modularity of protein structure to address regulatory complexity. Rather than treating proteins as \"black boxes\", we model their hierarchical structure and, as conformational changes, internal dynamics. By modelling the regulation of allosteric proteins through these conformational changes, we often decrease the number of parameters required to fit data, and so reduce over-fitting and improve the predictive power of a model. Our method is thermodynamically grounded, imposes detailed balance, and also includes molecular cross-talk and the background activity of enzymes. We use our Allosteric Network Compiler to examine how allostery can facilitate macromolecular assembly and how competitive ligands can change the observed cooperativity of an allosteric protein.

Most newly created gene networks are nonfunctioning due to intrinsic parameter fluctuations, uncertain interactions with unknown molecules and external disturbances of intra and extracellular environments on the host cell. How to design a completely new gene network, that is to track some desired behaviors under these intrinsic and extrinsic disturbances on the host cell, is the most important topic in synthetic biology. In this study, the intrinsic parameter fluctuations, uncertain interactions with unknown molecules and environmental disturbances, are modeled into the nonlinear stochastic systems of synthetic gene networks in vivo. Four design specifications are introduced to guarantee the stochastic synthetic gene network, which can achieve robust optimal tracking of a desired reference model in spite of these intrinsic and extrinsic disturbances on the host cell. However, the robust optimal reference-tracking design problem of nonlinear synthetic gene networks is still hard to solve. In order to simplify the design procedure of the robust optimal nonlinear stochastic-tracking design for synthetic gene networks, the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy method is introduced to solve the nonlinear stochastic minimum-error-tracking design problem. Hence, the robust optimal reference-tracking design problem under four design specifications can be solved by the linear matrix inequality (LMI)-constrained optimization method using convex optimization techniques. Further, a simple design procedure is developed for synthetic gene networks to meet the four design specifications to achieve robust optimal reference tracking.

Awell-recognized conceptual insight is provided by a general mathematical relation, Hamilton's rule. This rule can in principle be invoked to explain natural examples of cooperation, but measuring the variables that it involves is a particularly challenging problem and controlling these variables experimentally an even more daunting task. Here, we overcome these difficulties by using a simple synthetic microbial system of producers and nonproducers of an extracellular growth-enhancing molecule, which acts as a 'common good.' For this system, we are able to manipulate the intrinsic growth difference between producers and nonproducers, as well as the impact of the common good on the growth rate of its recipients. Our synthetic system is thus uniquely suited for studying the relation between the parameters entering Hamilton's rule and the quantities governing the systems' behavior. The experimental results highlight a crucial effect of nonlinearities in the response to the common good, which in general tend to limit the predictive value of Hamilton's rule.

Guided by a mathematical model derived from existing quantitative knowledge, rational designs of transcriptional NAND, NOR and NOT gates have been realized. The NAND gates have been designed based on direct protein-protein interactions in coupling with DNA looping. We demonstrated that the designs are reusable: a multiplex of logic devices can be readily created using the same designs but different combinations of sequence variants. The designed logic gates are combinable to form compound circuits: a demonstration logic circuit containing all three types of designed logic gates has been synthesized, and the circuit truthfully reproduces the pre-designed input-output logic relations.

However, the cell membrane is designed by nature to be an insulator, restricting the flow of charged species, therefore, introducing a biocompatible pathway for transferring electrons across the membrane without disrupting the cell is a significant challenge. Here we describe a genetic strategy to move intracellular electrons to an inorganic extracellular acceptor along a molecularly defined route. To do so, we reconstitute a portion of the extracellular electron transfer chain of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 into the model microbe Escherichia coli. This engineered E. coli can reduce metal ions and solid metal oxides similar to 8x and similar to 4x faster than its parental strain. We also find that metal oxide reduction is more efficient when the extracellular electron acceptor has nanoscale dimensions. This work demonstrates that a genetic cassette can create a conduit for electronic communication from living cells to inorganic materials, and it highlights the importance of matching the size scale of the protein donors to inorganic acceptors."}},{"pk": "1147", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "6", "pubYear": 2010, "doi": "10.1038/nchembio.487", "sbw": 0, "title": "Transforming biosynthesis into an information science", "pubMonth": "12", "journal": 1146, "abstract": "Engineering biosynthetic pathways to natural products is a challenging endeavor that promises to provide new therapeutics and tools to manipulate biology.

Gravimetric density of polysaccharides is 14.8 H-2 mass% where water can be recycled from PEM fuel cells or 8.33% H-2 mass% without water recycling, volumetric densities of polysaccharides are >100 kg of H-2/m(3). Renewable carbohydrates (e.g., cellulosic materials and starch) are less expensive based on GJ than are other hydrogen carriers, such as hydrocarbons, biodiesel, methanol, ethanol, and ammonia. Biotransformation of carbohydrates to hydrogen by cell-free synthetic (enzymatic) pathway biotransformation (SyPaB) has numerous advantages, such as high product yield (12 H-2/glucose unit), 100% selectivity, high energy conversion efficiency (122%, based on combustion energy), high-purity hydrogen generated, mild reaction conditions, low-cost of bioreactor, few safety concerns, and nearly no toxicity hazards. Although SyPaB may suffer from current low reaction rates, numerous approaches for accelerating hydrogen production rates are proposed and discussed. Potential applications of carbohydrate-based hydrogen/electricity generation would include hydrogen bioreactors, home-size electricity generators, sugar batteries for portable electronics, sugar-powered passenger vehicles, and so on. Developments in thermostable enzymes as standardized building blocks for cell-free SyPaB projects, use of stable and low-cost biomimetic NAD cofactors, and accelerating reaction rates are among the top research & development priorities.

The basic design of the consortium consisted of four different engineered yeast strains capable of either displaying a trifunctional scaffoldin, Scaf-ctf (SC), carrying three divergent cohesin domains from Clostridium thermocellum (t), Clostridium cellulolyticum (c), and Ruminococcus flavefaciens (f), or secreting one of the three corresponding dockerin-tagged cellulases (endoglucanase [AT], exoglucanase [EC/CB], or beta-glucosidase [BF]). The secreted cellulases were docked onto the displayed Scaf-ctf in a highly organized manner based on the specific interaction of the three cohesin-dockerin pairs employed, resulting in the assembly of a functional minicellulosome on the yeast surface. By exploiting the modular nature of each population to provide a unique building block for the minicellulosome structure, the overall cellulosome assembly, cellulose hydrolysis, and ethanol production were easily fine-tuned by adjusting the ratio of different populations in the consortium. The optimized consortium consisted of a SC: AT: CB: BF ratio of 7:2:4:2 and produced almost twice the level of ethanol (1.87 g/liter) as a consortium with an equal ratio of the different populations. The final ethanol yield of 0.475 g of ethanol/g of cellulose consumed also corresponded to 93% of the theoretical value.

In the face of these enormous challenges, biomass has emerged as a viable alternative to petroleum for the production of energy, chemicals, and materials owing to its abundance, inexpensiveness, and carbon-neutrality. Moreover, the immense ease and efficiency of biological systems at converting biomass-derived feedstocks into fuels, chemicals, and materials has generated renewed interest in biotechnology as a replacement for traditional chemical processes. Aided by the ever-expanding repertoire of microbial genetics and plant biotechnology, improved understanding of gene regulation and cellular metabolism, and incessantly accumulating gene and protein data, scientists are now contemplating engineering microbial cell factories to produce fuels, chemical feedstocks, polymers and pharmaceuticals in an economically and environmentally sustainable way. This goal resonates with that of metabolic engineering the improvement of cellular properties through the intelligent design, rational modification, or directed evolution of biochemical pathways, and arguably, metabolic engineering seems best positioned to achieve the concomittant goals of environmental stewardship and economic prolificity. Improving a host organism's cellular traits and the potential design of new phenotypes is strongly dependent on the ability to effectively control the organism's genetic machinery. In fact, finely-tuned gene expression is imperative for achieving an optimal balance between pathway expression and cell viability, while avoiding cytotoxicity due to accumulation of certain gene products or metabolites. Early attempts to engineer a cell's metabolism almost exclusively relied on merely deleting or over-expressing single or multiple genes using recombinant DNA, and intervention targets were predominantly selected based on knowledge of the stoichiometry, kinetics, and regulation of the pathway of interest. However, the distributive nature of metabolic control, as opposed to the existence of a single rate-limiting step, predicates the controlled expression of multiple enzymes in several coordinated pathways to achieve the desired flux, and, as such, simple strategies involving either deleting or over-expressing genes are greatly limited in this context. On the other hand, the use of synthetic or modified promoters, riboswitches, tunable intergenic regions, and translation modulators such as internal ribosome entry sequences, upstream open reading frames, optimized mRNA secondary structures, and RNA silencing have been shown to be enormously conducive to achieving the fine-tuning of gene expression. These modifications to the genetic machinery of the host organism can be best achieved via the use of synthetic DNA technology, and the constant improvement in the affordability and quality of oligonucleotide synthesis suggests that these might well become the mainstay of the metabolic engineering toolbox in the years to come.

Engineering of microorganisms has proven to be a valuable tool and the concept has been transferred to plant science opening new promising perspectives. Engineering has been conducted for crop plants, but the application of this technique to medicinal plants has not yet been explored well so far. Nowadays the cloning and expression of multiple genes and genomic integration are of high interest. This allows the reconstitution of biosynthetic pathways in heterologous organisms, being either plants or microorganisms. Combining basic science and applied engineering in this research area has been named combinatorial biosynthesis and later as synthetic biology. Synthetic biology comprises a large number of subareas, including enzymology, protein assembly and interactions, metabolomics, gene regulation, signal transduction and computational biology and is considered as an important future approach for biotechnological plant optimization. Synthetic biology has exciting perspectives for the exploitation of medicinal and aromatic plants, in order to increase the level of desired natural products, to gain insight in metabolic pathways even for new similar chemicals, to improve nutritional and health promoting effects of foods (nutraceuticals), and to reduce the amount of undesired side products with potential toxic or allergic activities."}},{"pk": "1527", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "16", "pubYear": 2010, "doi": "", "sbw": 0, "title": "Building Blocks for Synthetic Biology: A Basis Set of Coiled Coils of Defined Oligomeric State.", "pubMonth": "9", "journal": 1526, "abstract": ""}},{"pk": "1556", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "49", "pubYear": 2010, "doi": "10.1021/bi100398p", "sbw": 0, "title": "Three-Dimensional Structures Reveal Multiple ADP/ATP Binding Modes for a Synthetic Class of Artificial Proteins", "pubMonth": "10", "journal": 1555, "abstract": "The creation of synthetic enzymes with predefined functions represents a major challenge in future synthetic biology applications. Here, we describe six structures of de novo proteins that have been determined using protein crystallography to address how simple enzymes perform catalysis. Three structures are of a protein, DX, selected for its stability and ability to tightly bind ATP. Despite the addition of ATP to the crystallization conditions, the presence of a bound but distorted ATP was found only under excess ATP conditions, with ADP being present under equimolar conditions or when crystallized for a prolonged period of time. A bound ADP cofactor was evident when Asp was substituted for Val at residue 65, but ATP in a linear configuration is present when Phe was substituted for Tyr at residue 43. These new structures complement previously determined structures of DX and the protein with the Pile 43 to Tyr substitution [Simmons, C. R., et al. (2009) ACS Client.

Here, we focus on the p53 signaling pathway as a template for constructing a tunable oscillator comprised of both natural and synthetic components in mammalian cells. We find that a reduced p53 circuit implementing a single feedback loop preserves some features of the full network's dynamics, exhibiting pulses of p53 with tightly controlled timing. However, in contrast to the full natural p53 network, these pulses are damped in individual cells, with amplitude that depends on the input strength. Guided by a computational model of the reduced circuit, we constructed and analyzed circuit variants supplemented with synthetic positive and negative feedback loops and subjected to chemical perturbation. Our work demonstrates that three important features of oscillator dynamics-amplitude, period, and the rate of damping-can be controlled by manipulating stimulus level, interaction strength, and feedback topology.

In our theoretical model, genotypes involve ordered combinations of DNA elements representing promoters, protein-coding genes, and transcription terminators, genotypic interconversions are driven by a recombinase enzyme that inverts DNA segments, and selectable phenotypes correspond to distinct patterns of gene expression. We analyze the microbial population as it evolves along a graph whose nodes are distinct genotypes and whose edges are interconversions. We show that the steady-state proportion of each genotype depends on its own growth advantage, as well as on its connectivity to other genotypes. Multiple phenotypes with identical or distinct growth rates can be indefinitely maintained in the population, while their proportion can be regulated by varying the rate of DNA flipping.

Within the stochastic framework, the base pairing strength between sRNA and mRNA plays an important role in controlling the transition time between on and off states.

As a first step toward RNA recognition, we utilized the RNA binding domain of argonaute, implicated in RNA interference, for specifically targeting generic 2-nucleotide, 3' overhangs of any dsRNA. We tested the reassembly of a split-luciferase enzyme guided by argonaute-mediated recognition of newly generated nucleotide overhangs when ssRNA is targeted by a designed complementary guide sequence. This approach was successful when argonaute was utilized in conjunction with a pumilio repeat and expanded the scope of potential ssRNA targets. However, targeting any desired ssRNA remained elusive as two argonaute domains provided minimal reassembled split-luciferase. We next designed and tested a second hierarchical assembly, wherein ssDNA guides are appended to DNA hairpins that serve as a scaffold for high affinity zinc fingers attached to split-luciferase. In the presence of a ssRNA target containing adjacent sequences complementary to the guides, the hairpins are brought into proximity, allowing for zinc finger binding and concomitant reassembly of the fragmented luciferase.

Whilst a number of groups are making headway towards such applications, there is a general challenge to translate a wealth of excellent basic research into materials with a genuine future in real-life applications. Amongst other contemporary aspects of this evolving research area, a key issue is that of decorating or functionalising what are mostly bare scaffolds. There are a number of hurdles to overcome to achieve effective and controlled labelling of the scaffolds, for instance: maintaining biocompatibility, i.e., by minimising covalent chemistry, or using milder bioconjugation methods, attaining specified levels of decoration, and, in particular, high and stoichiometric labelling, introducing orthogonality, such that two or more functions can be appended to the same scaffold, and, in relevant cases, maintaining the possibility for recombinant peptide/protein production.

In contrast, those signatures that act as promiscuity determinants are significantly depleted around non-promiscuous catalytic sites. In addition, we present the study of the enolase and aminotransferase superfamilies as illustrative examples of characterization of promiscuous enzymes within a superfamily and achievement of enzyme promiscuity by protein reverse engineering. Recognizing the role of enzyme promiscuity in the process of natural evolution of enzymatic function can provide useful hints in the design of directed evolution experiments. We have developed a method with potential applications in the guided discovery and enhancement of latent catalytic capabilities surviving in modern enzymes."}},{"pk": "2089", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "49", "pubYear": 2010, "doi": "10.1021/bi100793y", "sbw": 0, "title": "Regulation of beta-Lactamase Activity by Remote Binding of Heme: Functional Coupling of Unrelated Proteins through Domain Insertion", "pubMonth": "8", "journal": 1555, "abstract": "Coupling the activities of normally disparate proteins into one functional unit has significant potential in terms of constructing novel switching components for synthetic biology or as biosensors. It also provides a means of investigating the basis behind transmission of conformation events between remote sites that is integral to many biological processes, including allostery. Here we describe how the structures and functions of two normally unlinked proteins, namely, the heme binding capability of cytochrome b(562) and the antibiotic degrading beta-lactamase activity of TEM, have been coupled using a directed evolution domain insertion approach. The important small biomolecule heme directly modulates in vivo and in vitro the beta-lactamase activity of selected integral fusion proteins. The presence of heme decreased the concentration of ampicillin tolerated by Escherichia coli and the level of in vitro hydrolysis of nitrocefin by up to 2 orders of magnitude. Variants with the largest switching magnitudes contained insertions at second-shell sites that abut key catalytic residues. Spectrophotometry confirmed that heme bound to the integral fusion proteins in a manner similar to that of cytochrome b(562). Circular dichroism suggested that only subtle structural changes rather than gross folding-unfolding events were responsible for modulating beta-lactamase activity, and size exclusion chromatography confirmed that the integral fusion proteins remained monomeric in both the apo and holo forms. Thus, by sampling a variety of insertion positions and linker sequences, we are able to couple the functions of two unrelated proteins by domain insertion."}},{"pk": "2110", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "", "pubYear": 2009, "doi": "", "sbw": 0, "title": "Multiscale Models for Synthetic Biology", "pubMonth": "0", "journal": 2073, "abstract": "Reacting systems away, from the thermodynamic limit cannot be accurately modeled with ordinary differential equations.

We describe the generation of robust but unexpected oscillations in the densities of bacterium Escherichia coli populations by simple synthetic suicide circuits containing quorum components and a lysis gene. Contrary to design expectations, oscillations required neither the quorum sensing genes (luxR and luxI) nor known regulatory elements in the P-luxI promoter. Instead, oscillations were likely due to density-dependent plasmid amplification that established a population-level negative feedback. A mathematical model based on this mechanism captures the key characteristics of oscillations, and model predictions regarding perturbations to plasmid amplification were experimentally validated.

A number of studies have been reported for improving this expression system. However, its physiology and cellular metabolism still remained largely uncharacterized. Thus, it is highly desirable to establish a systems biotechnological framework, in which a comprehensive in silico model of P. pastoris can be employed together with high throughput experimental data analysis, for better understanding of the methylotrophic yeast's metabolism. Results: A fully compartmentalized metabolic model of P. pastoris (iPP668), composed of 1,361 reactions and 1,177 metabolites, was reconstructed based on its genome annotation and biochemical information. The constraints-based flux analysis was then used to predict achievable growth rate which is consistent with the cellular phenotype of P. pastoris observed during chemostat experiments. Subsequent in silico analysis further explored the effect of various carbon sources on cell growth, revealing sorbitol as a promising candidate for culturing recombinant P. pastoris strains producing heterologous proteins. Interestingly, methanol consumption yields a high regeneration rate of reducing equivalents which is substantial for the synthesis of valuable pharmaceutical precursors. Hence, as a case study, we examined the applicability of P. pastoris system to whole-cell biotransformation and also identified relevant metabolic engineering targets that have been experimentally verified. Conclusion: The genome-scale metabolic model characterizes the cellular physiology of P. pastoris, thus allowing us to gain valuable insights into the metabolism of methylotrophic yeast and devise possible strategies for strain improvement through in silico simulations.

This precisely tunes the distances between the DNA reading heads in WH1 and the C-terminal domain (WH2), to match the target operator or iteron sequences.

We found that the properties of the LuxR activator had a significant impact on the observed behavior of the coupled feedback loop circuit, as a slow degradation rate of LuxR led to its accumulation after initial circuit induction. Due to this accumulation, the presence of feedback on LuxR did not greatly alter the oscillatory behavior of the circuit from a control consisting of an independent negative feedback loop, with both systems showing oscillatory responses in 30-40% of the measured cells and highly variable periods. While the oscillatory properties of individual cells were not influenced by induction levels, the percentage of cells that demonstrated oscillations was. Slight improvements to the initial responses of the coupled feedback loop circuit were also obtained by coexpression of the GroE chaperones due to improved LuxR folding.

For all glycoside substrates tested at 50 mm phosphate buffer this catalysis is superior to previously reported results for 6(A),6(D)-dicyanohydrin cyclodextrin (CD) artificial glycosidases, i.e. analogues which have their catalytic group one carbon atom closer to the cyclodextrin cavity. This provides proof of substantial flexibility within the catalysis exerted by these CD chemzymes. A series of permethylated mono- and dicyanohydrin alpha- and beta-CDs were also synthesized, and these showed more modest catalytic rate enhancements of up to 110 times (10% catalysis rate, relative to non-methylated analogues), implying that the permethylation blocks or hampers catalytically important binding between the saccharide part of the substrate and the CD.

These assays are difficult and in vitro measurements may not approximate actual in vivo conditions. Alternatively, changes in transcription factor activity can be estimated by using partially specified models which estimate the \"hidden functions\" of transcription factor concentration changes, however, non-unique solutions are a potential problem. We have applied a synthetic biology approach to develop reporters that are capable of measuring transcription factor activity in vivo in real time. These synthetic reporters are comprised of a constitutive promoter with an operator site for the specific transcription factor immediately downstream. Thus, increasing transcription factor activity is measured as repression of expression of the transcription factor reporter. Measuring repression instead of activation avoids the complications of non-linear interactions between the transcription factor and RNA polymerase which differs at each promoter. Results: Using these reporters, we show that a simple model is capable of determining the rules of integration for multiple transcriptional inputs at the four promoters of the arabinose catabolic pathway. Furthermore, we show that despite the complex and non-linear changes in cAMP-CRP activity in vivo during diauxic shift, the synthetic transcription factor reporters are capable of measuring real-time changes in transcription factor activity, and the simple model is capable of predicting the dynamic behaviour of the catabolic promoters. Conclusions: Using a synthetic biology approach we show that the in vivo activity of transcription factors can be quantified without the need for measuring intracellular concentrations, binding affinities and reaction rates. Using measured transcription factor activity we show how different promoters can integrate common transcriptional inputs, resulting in distinct expression patterns. The data collected show that cAMP levels in vivo are dynamic and agree with observations showing that cAMP levels show a transient pulse during diauxic shift."}},{"pk": "2572", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "4", "pubYear": 2010, "doi": "10.1186/1752-0509-4-66", "sbw": 0, "title": "Avoiding transcription factor competition at promoter level increases the chances of obtaining oscillation", "pubMonth": "5", "journal": 2557, "abstract": "Background: The ultimate goal of synthetic biology is the conception and construction of genetic circuits that are reliable with respect to their designed function (e. g. oscillators, switches). This task remains still to be attained due to the inherent synergy of the biological building blocks and to an insufficient feedback between experiments and mathematical models. Nevertheless, the progress in these directions has been substantial. Results: It has been emphasized in the literature that the architecture of a genetic oscillator must include positive (activating) and negative (inhibiting) genetic interactions in order to yield robust oscillations. Our results point out that the oscillatory capacity is not only affected by the interaction polarity but by how it is implemented at promoter level. For a chosen oscillator architecture, we show by means of numerical simulations that the existence or lack of competition between activator and inhibitor at promoter level affects the probability of producing oscillations and also leaves characteristic fingerprints on the associated period/amplitude features. Conclusions: In comparison with non-competitive binding at promoters, competition drastically reduces the region of the parameters space characterized by oscillatory solutions. Moreover, while competition leads to pulse-like oscillations with long-tail distribution in period and amplitude for various parameters or noisy conditions, the noncompetitive scenario shows a characteristic frequency and confined amplitude values.

Streamlined-genome E. coli MDS42 is free of mutation-generating IS elements, and can serve as a host with reduced evolutionary potential. Results: We analyze an extreme case of toxic plasmid clone instability, and show that random host IS element hopping, causing inactivation of the toxic cloned sequences, followed by automatic selection of the fast-growing mutants, can prevent the maintenance of a clone developed for vaccine production. Analyzing the molecular details, we identify a hydrophobic protein as the toxic byproduct of the clone, and show that IS elements spontaneously landing in the cloned fragment relieve the cell from the stress by blocking transcription of the toxic gene. Bioinformatics analysis of sequence reads from early shotgun genome sequencing projects, where clone libraries were constructed and maintained in E. coli, suggests that such IS-mediated inactivation of ectopic genes inhibiting the growth of the E. coli cloning host might happen more frequently than generally anticipated, leading to genomic instability and selection of altered clones.

To this end, synthetic biologists propose assembling metabolic pathways in toto by combining genes isolated from a variety of sources. While pathway construction is similar to approaches established long ago by Metabolic Engineering, the two methods deviate significantly when it comes to pathway optimization. Synthetic biologists opt for gene-combinatorial methods whereby large numbers of pathways, comprising several combinations of genes from different sources, and their mutants, are evaluated in search for an optimal pathway configuration. Metabolic engineering, on the contrary, aims to optimize pathways by tuning the activity of the intermediate reaction steps.

Thus far, detection of virus-derived miRNAs has been largely limited to DNA viruses, suggesting that RNA viruses may be unable to exploit this aspect of transcriptional regulation. Lack of RNA virus-produced miRNAs has been attributed to the replicative constraints that would incur following RNase III processing of a genomic hairpin. To ascertain whether the generation of viral miRNAs is limited to DNA viruses, we investigated whether influenza virus could be designed to deliver functional miRNAs without affecting replication.

Insertion of the miR-124 hairpin into an intron of the nuclear export protein transcript resulted in endogenous processing and functional miR-124. We demonstrate that a viral RNA genome incorporating a hairpin does not result in segment instability or miRNA-mediated genomic targeting, thereby permitting the virus to produce a miRNA without having a negative impact on viral replication.

One of the essential challenges hampering the construction of such systems is the need to precisely optimize protein expression levels for robust operation. However, it is difficult to design mRNA sequences for expression at targeted protein levels, since even a few nucleotide modifications around the start codon may alter translational efficiency and dramatically (up to 250-fold) change protein expression. Previous studies have used ad hoc approaches (e. g., random mutagenesis) to obtain the desired translational efficiencies for mRNA sequences. Hence, the development of a mathematical methodology capable of estimating translational efficiency would greatly facilitate the future design of mRNA sequences aimed at yielding desired protein expression levels. Results: We herein propose a mathematical model that focuses on translation initiation, which is the rate-limiting step in translation. The model uses mRNA-folding dynamics and ribosome-binding dynamics to estimate translational efficiencies solely from mRNA sequence information. We confirmed the feasibility of our model using previously reported expression data on the MS2 coat protein. For further confirmation, we used our model to design 22 luxR mRNA sequences predicted to have diverse translation efficiencies ranging from 10(-5) to 1. The expression levels of these sequences were measured in Escherichia coli and found to be highly correlated (R-2 = 0.87) with their estimated translational efficiencies. Moreover, we used our computational method to successfully transform a low-expressing DsRed2 mRNA sequence into a high-expressing mRNA sequence by maximizing its translational efficiency through the modification of only eight nucleotides upstream of the start codon. Conclusions: We herein describe a mathematical model that uses mRNA sequence information to estimate translational efficiency. This model could be used to design best-fit mRNA sequences having a desired protein expression level, thereby facilitating protein over-production in biotechnology or the protein expression-level optimization necessary for the construction of robust networks in synthetic biology."}},{"pk": "2855", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "61", "pubYear": 2010, "doi": "10.1146/annurev-arplant-042809-112206", "sbw": 0, "title": "Improving Photosynthetic Efficiency for Greater Yield", "pubMonth": "0", "journal": 2854, "abstract": "Increasing the yield potential of the major food grain crops has contributed very significantly to a rising food supply over the past 50 years, which has until recently more than kept pace with rising global demand.

Using appropriately engineered fast-folding Enhanced Green Fluorescence Protein (EGFP), as a model, here we show that TAT is essential for not only translocating fast-folding lipoprotein but also its lipid modification. EGFP was lipid-modified and targeted to the outer membrane's outer surface with a prototypical TAT signal sequence containing lipobox but not with the lipoprotein or TAT signal sequence. Justifiably signal sequences of many substrate-binding and co-factor-containing lipoproteins contained both TAT-box and lipobox (Shruthi et al., submitted). Cytoplasmic accumulation of unmodified precursors of engineered EGFP in a tatC mutant implicated this TAT-box-recognizing component in lipid-modification. Similar observations reported earlier with Sec components and murein lipoprotein led us to propose that the translocation-competent and translocase-associated (Sec or TAT) precursor form is prerequisite to initiation of lipid-modification in vivo.

This technology promises to provide a means to add many genes to a synthetic chromosome in sequential manner. An additional advantage is that the multiple transgenes will not be inserted into the normal chromosomes and thus will not exhibit linkage drag when converging the transgenes to different germplasm nor will they be mutagenic. Telomere truncation coupled with the introduction of site-specific recombination cassettes has proven to be an easy method to produce minichromosomes. Telomere truncation results from the transformation of plasmids carrying a block of telomere repeats at one end. Minichromosomes consisting of little more than a centromere have been produced for B chromosomes of maize. Such small chromosomes have been studied for their meiotic behavior, which differs from normal sized chromosomes in that homologue pairing is rare or nonexistent and sister chromatid cohesion fails at meiosis I. Potential modifications of the minichromosomes that can address these issues are discussed. Minichromosomes can be recovered from transformed plants that are polyploid or that carry an additional chromosome as the preferred target for truncation. Site-specific recombination has been demonstrated to operate on these terminally located sites. By introducing normal B chromosomes into lines with engineered mini-B chromosomes, the latter can be increased in copy number, which provides the potential to augment the expression of the introduced genes. Because the vast majority of plant species have the same telomere sequence, the truncating transgenes should be effective in most plants to generate engineered minichromosomes.

There have been recent attempts to improve the rate and specificity of Rubisco, the carboxylating enzyme operating in the Calvin-Benson cycle, however, they have achieved only limited success. Nature employs several alternative carbon fixation pathways, which prompted us to ask whether more efficient novel synthetic cycles could be devised. Using the entire repertoire of approximately 5,000 metabolic enzymes known to occur in nature, we computationally identified alternative carbon fixation pathways that combine existing metabolic building blocks from various organisms. We compared the natural and synthetic pathways based on physicochemical criteria that include kinetics, energetics, and topology. Our study suggests that some of the proposed synthetic pathways could have significant quantitative advantages over their natural counterparts, such as the overall kinetic rate. One such cycle, which is predicted to be two to three times faster than the Calvin-Benson cycle, employs the most effective carboxylating enzyme, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, using the core of the naturally evolved C4 cycle.

Accordingly, the mutations obey a simple 'similar replaces similar' rule as disruption of the resulting protein structure is minimized by the modest alterations in the amino acid side chains. At laboratory level such non-destructive modifications have to be incorporated in a controlled manner by integrating the chemical diversity achieved in synthetic chemistry into proteins. For this purpose the most straightforward route is generation of the synthetic proteins by the cellular translational apparatus via insertion of isosteric synthetic amino acid analogs during gene expression. This leads to target proteins with chemical diversity not found in nature. Such genetic code engineering does not require any DNA mutagenesis step as it produces extensive sequence variations at the level of protein translation. It is generally achieved either by expansion of the existing amino acid repertoire or by introduction of novel coding units. Here we highlight the concept of using isosteric noncanonical amino acid analogs analogs for in vivo protein synthesis as a useful tool to dissect, study and manipulate protein folding and conformational stability with two examples, the prion protein and green fluorescent protein. In the first example, we show how alternative translation of the single gene sequence by different synthetic amino acids enables the protein to fold into stable, but differing conformations. In particular, replacement of methionine by the isosteric analogs norleucine/metoxinine provide a chemical model to dissect the role of hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity in the a alpha --> beta conversion of the prion protein structure. In the second example, proline residues in green fluorescent protein are replaced with (4S)-fluoroproline which improves folding and overall stability of the protein. Indeed, fluorination of the protein matrix creates a network of favorable local interactions absent in the parent (i.e. natural) protein.

Further, targeted libraries are usually restricted to a handful of amino acids because there is an exponential correlation between the number of residues randomized and the size of the resulting ensemble. Using GFP as the model protein, we present a strategy, termed protein evolution via amino acid and codon elimination, through which simplified, native-like polypeptides encoded by a reduced genetic code were obtained via screening of reduced-size ensembles. Methodology/Principal Findings: The strategy involves combining a sequential mutagenesis scheme to reduce library size with structurally stabilizing mutations, chaperone complementation, and reduced temperature of gene expression. In six steps, we eliminated a common buried residue, Phe, from the green fluorescent protein (GFP), while retaining activity. A GFP variant containing 11 Phe residues was used as starting scaffold to generate 10 separate variants in which each Phe was replaced individually (in one construct two adjacent Phe residues were changed simultaneously), while retaining varying levels of activity. Combination of these substitutions to generate a Phe-free variant of GFP abolished fluorescence. Combinatorial re-introduction of five Phe residues, based on the activities of the respective single amino acid replacements, was sufficient to restore GFP activity. Successive rounds of mutagenesis generated active GFP variants containing, three, two, and zero Phe residues. These GFPs all displayed progenitor-like fluorescence spectra, temperature-sensitive folding, a reduced structural stability and, for the least stable variants, a reduced steady state abundance.

We select two sets of RNA aptamers that bind planar ligands with dissociation constants (K(d)s) ranging from 65 nM to 100 mu M in physiological buffer conditions. Aptamers selected to bind the non-proteinogenic amino acid, p-amino phenylalanine (pAF), are larger and more informationally complex (i.e., rarer in a pool of random sequences) than aptamers selected to bind a larger fluorescent dye, tetramethylrhodamine (TMR). Interestingly, tighter binding aptamers show less dependence on magnesium than weaker-binding aptamers. Thus, selection for high-affinity binding may automatically lead to structures that are functional in physiological conditions (1-2.5 mM Mg2+). We hypothesize that selection for high-affinity binding in physiological conditions is primarily constrained by ligand characteristics such as molecular weight (MW) and the number of rotatable bonds.

The Muller C-element is a standard logic gate commonly used to synchronize independent processes in most asynchronous electronic circuits. Synthetic biological logic gates have been previously demonstrated, but there remain many open issues in the design of sequential (state-holding) logic operations. Three designs are considered for the genetic Muller C-element: a majority gate, a toggle switch, and a speed-independent implementation. While the three designs are logically equivalent, each design requires different assumptions to operate correctly. The majority gate design requires the most timing assumptions, the speed-independent design requires the least, and the toggle switch design is a compromise between the two. This paper examines the robustness of these designs as well as the effects of parameter variation using stochastic simulation. The results show that robustness to timing assumptions does not necessarily increase reliability, suggesting that modifications to existing logic design tools are going to be necessary for synthetic biology. Parameter variation simulations yield further insights into the design principles necessary for building robust genetic gates. The results suggest that high gene count, cooperativity of at least two, tight repression, and balanced decay rates are necessary for robust gates.

Among the elements forming regulatory networks in bacteria are regulatory proteins such as transcription factors, which respond to exogenous and endogenous conditions. To perceive their surroundings, bacteria have evolved sensory regulatory systems of two-components. The archetype of these systems is made up of two proteins a signal sensor and a response regulator whose genes are usually located together in a single transcription unit. These units switch transcriptional programs in response to environmental conditions. Here, we study 14 two-component systems in Escherichia coil, which have been experimentally characterized with respect to their transcriptional regulation and their perceived signal. Given that the activity of these sensory units is connected to the rest of the transcriptional network, we first classify them as autonomous, semiautonomous or dependent, according to whether or not they use additional regulators to be transcribed. Next, we use discrete-time models to simulate their qualitative regulatory dynamics in response to their transcriptional regulation and to the activation of these systems by their cognate signals. Compared to more traditional ordinary differential equations method, ours has the advantage of being computationally simple and mathematically tractable, while keeping the ability to reproduce the phenomenology described by non-linear models. The aim of the present work is not the study of all possible behaviors of these two-component systems, but to exemplify those behaviors reported in the literature. On the other hand, most of these systems are auto-activating switches, a property that distinguishes them from the other transcription factors in the regulatory network, which are mostly auto-repressing. Based on the data, our models show dynamic behaviors that explain how most of these sensory systems convey abilities for multistationarity, and these dynamic properties could explain the phenotypic heterogeneity observed in bacterial populations.

Heterologous expression of novel combinations of enzymes promises to provide new or improved synthetic routes towards a substantially increased diversity of small molecules. Recently, we constructed a synthetic pathway to produce D-glucaric acid, a molecule that has been deemed a \"top-value added chemical'' from biomass, starting from glucose. Limiting flux through the pathway is the second recombinant step, catalyzed by myo-inositol oxygenase (MIOX), whose activity is strongly influenced by the concentration of the myo-inositol substrate. To synthetically increase the effective concentration of myo-inositol, polypeptide scaffolds were built from protein-protein interaction domains to co-localize all three pathway enzymes in a designable complex as previously described (Dueber et al., 2009). Glucaric acid titer was found to be strongly affected by the number of scaffoldinteraction domains targeting upstream Ino1 enzymes, whereas the effect of increased numbers of MIOX-targeted domains was much less significant. We determined that the scaffolds directly increased the specific MIOX activity and that glucaric acid titers were strongly correlated with MIOX activity. Overall, we observed an approximately 5-fold improvement in product titers over the non-scaffolded control, and a 50% improvement over the previously reported highest titers.

A frequent application of measuring and redirecting intracellular fluxes is strain engineering, which ultimately aims at shifting metabolic activity toward a desired product to achieve a high yield and/or rate. In this article, we first review the assessment of intracellular flux distributions by either qualitative or rather quantitative computational methods and also discuss methods for experimental measurements.

The proposed method was applied to S. cerevisiae stress responses, elucidating the stress response mechanism of the yeast. From the resulting integrated cellular network under hyperosmotic stress, the highly connected hubs which are functionally relevant to the stress response were identified. Beyond hyperosmotic stress, the integrated network under heat shock and oxidative stress were also constructed and the crosstalks of these networks were analyzed, specifying the significance of some transcription factors to serve as the decision-making devices at the center of the bow-tie structure and the crucial role for rapid adaptation scheme to respond to stress.

The integration of transcription regulations and protein-protein interactions gives more insight into the actual biological network and is more predictive than those without integration.

Although SB could assist in addressing pressing global challenges, such as sustainable and renewable energy, there are considerable societal concerns that accompany its development and applications.

Problems associated with biosecurity, biosafety, intellectual property, and ethics are discussed in relation to the typology of SB applications to identify applications of the highest potential concern. Finally, policy options for SB oversight are considered, preventative to promotional.

The major challenge in this field is to reliably control stem cell behavior outside the body. Common biological col trol schemes often ignore physicochemical parameters that materials scientists and engineers commonly manipulate, such as substrate topography and mechanical and rheological properties. However, with appropriate attention to these parameters, researchers have designed novel synthetic microenvironments to control stem cell behavior in rather unnatural ways. In this Account, we review synthetic microenvironments that aim to overcome the limitations of natural niches rather than to mimic them. A biomimetic stem cell control strategy is often limited by an incomplete understanding of the complex signaling pathways that drive stem cell behavior from early embryogenesis to late adulthood. The stem cell extracellular environment presents a miscellany of competing biological signals that keep the cell in a state of unstable equilibrium. Using synthetic polymers, researchers have designed synthetic microenvironments with an uncluttered array of cell signals, both specific and nonspecific, that are motivated by rather than modeled after biology. These have proven useful in maintaining cell potency, studying asymmetric cell division, and controlling cellular differentiation.

The prototype microreactor is based on a 200-mu m ID fused silica capillary for quantitative kinetic analysis. The concept is based on the reversible immobilization of His(6)-tagged enzymes via Ni-NTA linkage to surface derivatized silica. For the initial microreactor design, the mode of operation is a stop-flow analysis which promotes higher degrees of conversion. Kinetics for the immobilized TK-catalysed synthesis of L-erythrulose from substrates glycolaldehyde (GA) and hydroxypyruvate (HPA) were evaluated based on a Michaelis-Menten model. Results show that the TK kinetic parameters in the IEMR (V-max(app) = 0.1 +/- 0.02 mmol min(-1), K-m(app) = 26 +/- 4 mM) are comparable with those measured in free solution. Furthermore, the k(cat) for the microreactor of 4.1 x 10(5) s(-1) was close to the value for the bioconversion in free solution.

The ability to quantify kinetic parameters of engineered enzymes at this scale has benefits for the rapid and parallel evaluation of evolved enzyme libraries for synthetic biology applications and for the generation of kinetic models to aid bioconversion process design and bioreactor selection as a more efficient alternative to previously established microwell-based systems for TK bioprocess characterization.

We constructed a detailed stochastic kinetic model of two component signalling based on published data. Our model has been validated with flow cytometry data and used to examine reporter gene expression in response to extracellular signal strength. The model shows that, depending on the actual kinetic parameters, TCSs exhibit all-or-none, graded or mixed mode responses. In accordance with other studies, positively autoregulated TCSs exhibit all-or-none responses. Unexpectedly, our model revealed that TCSs lacking a positive feedback loop exhibit not only graded but also mixed mode responses, in which variation of the signal strength alters the level of gene expression in induced cells while the regulated gene continues to be expressed at the basal level in a substantial fraction of cells. The graded response of the TCS changes to mixed mode response by an increase of the translation initiation rate of the histidine kinase. Thus, a TCS is an evolvable design pattern capable of implementing deterministic regulation and stochastic switches associated with both graded and threshold responses. This has implications for understanding the emergence of population diversity in pathogenic bacteria and the design of genetic circuits in synthetic biology applications.

For example, to synthesize a gene regulatory network, the derivation of a mathematical model is important in order to carry out in silico investigations of the network dynamics and to investigate parameter variations and robustness issues. Different mathematical frameworks have been proposed to derive such models. In particular, the use of sets of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) has been proposed to model the dynamics of the concentrations of mRNAs and proteins. These models are usually characterized by the presence of highly nonlinear Hill function terms. A typical simplification is to reduce the number of equations by means of a quasi-steady-state assumption on the mRNA concentrations. This yields a class of simplified ODE models. A radically different approach is to replace the Hill functions by piecewise-linear approximations [Casey, R., de Jong, H., Gouze, J.-L., 2006. Piecewise-linear models of genetic regulatory networks: equilibria and their stability. J. Math. Biol. 52( 1), 27-56]. A further modelling approach is the use of discrete-time maps [Coutinho, R., Fernandez, B., Lima, R., Meyroneinc, A., 2006. Discrete time piecewise affine models of genetic regulatory networks. J. Math. Biol. 52, 524-570] where the evolution of the system is modelled in discrete, rather than continuous, time. The aim of this paper is to discuss and compare these different modelling approaches, using a representative gene regulatory network. We will show that different models often lead to conflicting conclusions concerning the existence and stability of equilibria and stable oscillatory behaviours. Moreover, we shall discuss, where possible, the viability of making certain modelling approximations( e. g. quasi-steady-state mRNA dynamics or piecewise-linear approximations of Hill functions) and their effects on the overall system dynamics.

Cell-free SyPaB, as compared to microbial fermentation, has several distinctive advantages, such as high product yield, great engineering flexibility, high product titer, and fast reaction rate. Biocommodities (e.g., ethanol, hydrogen, and butanol) are low-value products where costs of feedstock carbohydrates often account for similar to 30-70% of the prices of the products. Therefore, yield of biocommodities is the most important cost factor, and the lowest yields of profitable biofuels are estimated to be ca. 70% of the theoretical yields of sugar-to-biofuels based on sugar prices of ca. US$ 0.18 per kg. The opinion that SyPaB is too costly for producing low-value biocommodities are mainly attributed to the lack of stable standardized building blocks (e.g., enzymes or their complexes), costly labile coenzymes, and replenishment of enzymes and coenzymes. In this perspective, I propose design principles for SyPaB, present several SyPaB examples for generating hydrogen, alcohols, and electricity, and analyze the advantages and limitations of SyPaB. The economical analyses clearly suggest that developments in stable enzymes or their complexes as standardized parts, efficient coenzyme recycling, and, use of low-cost and more stable biomimetic coenzyme analogs, would result in much lower production costs than do microbial fermentations because the stabilized enzymes have more than 3 orders of magnitude higher weight-based total turn-over numbers than microbial biocatalysts, although extra costs for enzyme purification and stabilization are spent.

Analogous to widely used 2',3'-dideoxynucleoside triphosphates (ddNTPs), dNTP-ONH(2)s terminate primer extension.

REAP combined with crystallographic analyses identified 35 sites where replacements might improve the ability of Taq to accept dNTP-ONH(2)s. A library of 93 Taq variants, each having replacements at three or four of these sites, held eight variants having improved ability to accept dNTP-ONH2 substrates.

They are evolutionarily determined by variables such as environment stability, nutrient availability, and community diversity. Selection for fast growth adaptively imprints genomes, resulting in gene amplification, adapted chromosomal organization, and biased codon usage. We found that these growth-related traits in 214 species of bacteria and archaea are highly correlated, suggesting they all result from growth optimization. While modeling their association with maximal growth rates in view of synthetic biology applications, we observed that codon usage biases are better correlates of growth rates than any other trait, including rRNA copy number. Systematic deviations to our model reveal two distinct evolutionary processes. First, genome organization shows more evolutionary inertia than growth rates. This results in over-representation of growth-related traits in fast degrading genomes. Second, selection for these traits depends on optimal growth temperature: for similar generation times purifying selection is stronger in psychrophiles, intermediate in mesophiles, and lower in thermophiles. Using this information, we created a predictor of maximal growth rate adapted to small genome fragments. We applied it to three metagenomic environmental samples to show that a transiently rich environment, as the human gut, selects for fast-growers, that a toxic environment, as the acid mine biofilm, selects for low growth rates, whereas a diverse environment, like the soil, shows all ranges of growth rates. We also demonstrate that microbial colonizers of babies gut grow faster than stabilized human adults gut communities. In conclusion, we show that one can predict maximal growth rates from sequence data alone, and we propose that such information can be used to facilitate the manipulation of generation times. Our predictor allows inferring growth rates in the vast majority of uncultivable prokaryotes and paves the way to the understanding of community dynamics from metagenomic data."}},{"pk": "5306", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "9", "pubYear": 2010, "doi": "10.1186/1475-2859-9-3", "sbw": 1, "title": "The path to next generation biofuels: successes and challenges in the era of synthetic biology", "pubMonth": "1", "journal": 2389, "abstract": "Volatility of oil prices along with major concerns about climate change, oil supply security and depleting reserves have sparked renewed interest in the production of fuels from renewable resources.

Here, we measure the effects of tandem copies of a small (18 bp) Class II T7 terminator from vesicular stomatitis virus on transcription in vitro and on translation in vitro and in vivo. We first test monomeric and dimeric gene constructs, then attempt extension to pentameric gene constructs. \"BioBrick\" versions of a pET vector and translation factor genes were constructed to facilitate cloning, and His-tags were incorporated to allow copurification of all protein products for relatively unbiased analysis and easy purification. Several results were surprising, including imbalanced expression of the pentameric constructs in vivo, illustrating the value of synthetic biology for investigating gene expression.

Synthetic genetic networks producing bistability and oscillations have been designed and constructed experimentally. However, in real biological systems, regulatory circuits are usually interconnected and the dynamics of those complex networks is often richer than the dynamics of simple modules. Here we couple the genetic Toggle switch and the Repressilator, two prototypic systems exhibiting bistability and oscillations, respectively. We study two types of coupling. In the first type, the bistable switch is under the control of the oscillator. Numerical simulation of this system allows us to determine the conditions under which a periodic switch between the two stable steady states of the Toggle switch occurs. In addition we show how birhythmicity characterized by the coexistence of two stable small-amplitude limit cycles, can easily be obtained in the system. In the second type of coupling, the oscillator is placed under the control of the Toggle switch. Numerical simulation of this system shows that this construction could for example be exploited to generate a permanent transition from a stable steady state to self-sustained oscillations (and vice versa) after a transient external perturbation. Those results thus describe qualitative dynamical behaviors that can be generated through the coupling of two simple network modules. These results differ from the dynamical properties resulting from interlocked feedback loops systems in which a given variable is involved at the same time in both positive and negative feedbacks.

On the basis of theoretical arguments, we predict that nonlinear interactions between two positive feedback loops can produce an ultrasensitive response that increases the range of cellular conditions at which bistability is observed. This prediction was experimentally tested by constructing a synthetic genetic circuit in Escherichia coli containing two well-characterized positive feedback loops, linked in a coherent fashion. The concerted action of both positive feedback loops resulted in bistable behavior over a broad range of inducer concentrations, when either of the feedback loops was removed, the range of inducer concentrations at which the system exhibited bistability was decreased by an order of magnitude. Furthermore, bistability of the system could be tuned by altering growth conditions that regulate the contribution of one of the feedback loops.

Peptide bond conformation as well as puckering propensity can be manipulated by proper choice of ring substituents, e. g. C-gamma-fluorination. Synthetic chemistry has routinely exploited ring-substituted proline analogs in order to change, modulate or control folding and stability of peptides. Methodology/Principal Findings: In order to transmit this synthetic strategy to complex proteins, the ten proline residues of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were globally replaced by (4R)- and (4S)-fluoroprolines (FPro). By this approach, we expected to affect the cis/trans peptidyl-proline bond isomerization and pyrrolidine ring puckering, which are responsible for the slow folding of this protein. Expression of both protein variants occurred at levels comparable to the parent protein, but the (4R)-FPro-EGFP resulted in irreversibly unfolded inclusion bodies, whereas the (4S)-FPro-EGFP led to a soluble fluorescent protein. Upon thermal denaturation, refolding of this variant occurs at significantly higher rates than the parent EGFP. Comparative inspection of the X-ray structures of EGFP and (4S)-FPro-EGFP allowed to correlate the significantly improved refolding with the C-gamma-endo puckering of the pyrrolidine rings, which is favored by 4S-fluorination, and to lesser extents with the cis/trans isomerization of the prolines. Conclusions/Significance: We discovered that the folding rates and stability of GFP are affected to a lesser extent by cis/trans isomerization of the proline bonds than by the puckering of pyrrolidine rings. In the C-gamma-endo conformation the fluorine atoms are positioned in the structural context of the GFP such that a network of favorable local interactions is established. From these results the combined use of synthetic amino acids along with detailed structural knowledge and existing protein engineering methods can be envisioned as a promising strategy for the design of complex tailor-made proteins and even cellular structures of superior properties compared to the native forms."}},{"pk": "5854", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "3", "pubYear": 2008, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0002671", "sbw": 9, "title": "Targeted Development of Registries of Biological Parts", "pubMonth": "7", "journal": 2161, "abstract": "Background: The design and construction of novel biological systems by combining basic building blocks represents a dominant paradigm in synthetic biology.

Methods/Principal Findings: By analyzing inclusion relationships between the sequences of the Registry entries, we build a network that can be related to the Registry abstraction hierarchy. The distribution of entry reuse and complexity was extracted from this network. The collection of clones associated with the database entries was also analyzed. The plasmid inserts were amplified and sequenced. The sequences of 162 inserts could be confirmed experimentally but unexpected discrepancies have also been identified. Conclusions/Significance: Organizational guidelines are proposed to help design and manage this new type of scientific resources. In particular, it appears necessary to compare the cost of ensuring the integrity of database entries and associated biological samples with their value to the users.

To produce these energy-rich products, a substrate is needed that feeds in reductive equivalents, When photosynthetic microorganisms learned to use water as a substrate some 2 billion years ago, a fundamental barrier against unlimited use of solar energy was overcome. The possibility of solar energy use has inspired researchers to construct artificial photosynthetic systems that show analogy to parts of the intricate molecular machinery of photosynthesis. Recent years have seen a reorientation of efforts toward creating integrated light-to-fuel systems that can use solar energy for direct synthesis of energy-rich compounds, so-called solar fuels. Sustainable production of solar fuels is a long awaited development that promises extensive solar energy use combined with long-term storage. The stoichiometry of water splitting into molecular oxygen, protons, and electrons is deceptively simple, achieving it by chemical catalysis has proven remarkably difficult. The reaction center Photosystem II couples light-induced charge separation to an efficient molecular water-splitting catalyst, a Mn4Ca complex, and is thus an important template for biomimetic chemistry. In our aims to design biomimetic manganese complexes for light-driven water oxidation, we link photosensitizers and charge-separation motifs to potential catalysts in supramolecular assemblies. In photosynthesis, production of carbohydrates demands the delivery of multiple reducing equivalents to CO2. In contrast, the two-electron reduction of protons to molecular hydrogen is much less demanding. Virtually all microorganisms have enzymes called hydrogenases that convert protons to hydrogen, many of them with good catalytic efficiency. The catalytic sites of hydrogenases are now the center of attention of biomimetic efforts, providing prospects for catalytic hydrogen production with inexpensive metals. Thus, we might complete the water-to-fuel conversion: light + 2H(2)O -> 2H(2) + O-2 This reaction formula is to some extent already elegantly fulfilled by cyanobacteria and green algae, water-splitting photosynthetic microorganisms that under certain conditions also can produce hydrogen. An alternative route to hydrogen from solar energy is therefore to engineer these organisms to produce hydrogen more efficiently. This Account describes our original approach to combine research in these two fields: mimicking structural and functional principles of both Photosystem II and hydrogenases by synthetic chemistry and engineering cyanobacteria to become better hydrogen producers and ultimately developing new routes toward synthetic biology."}},{"pk": "5957", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "6", "pubYear": 2010, "doi": "10.1039/b909200p", "sbw": 1, "title": "Incorporation of unnatural amino acids for synthetic biology", "pubMonth": "0", "journal": 2065, "abstract": "The challenge of synthetic biology lies in the construction of artificial cellular systems.

The Cl. thermocellum ORF Cthe1265 encoding a putative PGM was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified enzyme appeared to be a monomer with an estimated molecular weight of 64 center dot 9 kDa. This enzyme was found to be a dual-specificity enzyme - PGM/phosphomannomutase (PMM).

In Part I of this series, we proposed a theoretical framework integrating the concepts of developmental biology with those of process design to provide the rules for the design of biomimetic processes. We named this methodology \"developmental engineering'' to emphasize that it is not the tissue but the process of in vitro tissue development that has to be engineered. To formulate the process design rules in a rigorous way that will allow a computational design, we should refer to mathematical methods to model the biological process taking place in vitro. Tissue functions cannot be attributed to individual molecules but rather to complex interactions between the numerous components of a cell and interactions between cells in a tissue that form a network. For tissue engineering to advance to the level of a technologically driven discipline amenable to well-established principles of process engineering, a scientifically rigorous formulation is needed of the general design rules so that the behavior of networks of genes, proteins, or cells that govern the unfolding of developmental processes could be related to the design parameters. Now that sufficient experimental data exist to construct plausible mathematical models of many biological control circuits, explicit hypotheses can be evaluated using computational approaches to facilitate process design. Recent progress in systems biology has shown that the empirical concepts of developmental biology that we used in Part I to extract the rules of biomimetic process design can be expressed in rigorous mathematical terms. This allows the accurate characterization of manufacturing processes in tissue engineering as well as the properties of the artificial tissues themselves. In addition, network science has recently shown that the behavior of biological networks strongly depends on their topology and has developed the necessary concepts and methods to describe it, allowing therefore a deeper understanding of the behavior of networks during biomimetic processes. These advances thus open the door to a transition for tissue engineering from a substantially empirical endeavor to a technology-based discipline comparable to other branches of engineering."}},{"pk": "6260", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "396", "pubYear": 2010, "doi": "10.1016/j.ab.2009.08.033", "sbw": 0, "title": "A universal approach for promoter strength evaluation supported by the web-based tool PromCal", "pubMonth": "1", "journal": 6259, "abstract": "In genetic engineering, gene expression is often modulated by replacements in promoter regions.

This concept provides a finer level of granularity than the traditional notion of the gene. However, a method of formally relating how a set of parts relates to a function has not yet emerged. Synthetic biology both demands such a formalism and provides an ideal setting for testing hypotheses about relationships between DNA sequences and phenotypes beyond the gene-centric methods used in genetics. Attribute grammars are used in computer science to translate the text of a program source code into the computational operations it represents. By associating attributes with parts, modifying the value of these attributes using rules that describe the structure of DNA sequences, and using a multi-pass compilation process, it is possible to translate DNA sequences into molecular interaction network models. These capabilities are illustrated by simple example grammars expressing how gene expression rates are dependent upon single or multiple parts. The translation process is validated by systematically generating, translating, and simulating the phenotype of all the sequences in the design space generated by a small library of genetic parts. Attribute grammars represent a flexible framework connecting parts with models of biological function.

This coincides with direct confirmation of the preponderance of long interspersed elements in mammalian genomes at the nucleotide level by large scale sequencing efforts. Two assay systems have been prominently featured in L1 studies over the past decade, which are used to assess L1 activities in cultured cells and transgenic mice respectively. However, constructing retrotransposon assay vectors and subsequent mapping of integration sites remain technically challenging aspects of the field. Synthetic biology approaches have changed the playing field with regard to the strategic design of retrotransposons. To streamline the construction and optimization of synthetic retrotransposons, we have implemented a highly efficient modular design for L1 vectors allowing \"plug and play\" swapping of individual modules as new knowledge is gained and optimization of constructs proceeds. Seven functional modules are divided by strategically placed unique restriction sites. These are utilized to facilitate module exchange and construction of L1 vectors for gene targeting, transgenesis and cell culture assays. A \"double Sfil\" strategy utilizing two non-complementary overhangs allows insert swapping to be carried out with a single, robust restriction/ligation cycle. The double-Sfil strategy is generic and can be applied to many other problems in synthetic biology or genetic engineering. To facilitate genomic mapping of LI insertions, we have developed an optimized inverse PCR protocol using 4-base cutters and step-down cycling conditions. Using this protocol, de nova L1 insertions can be efficiently recovered after a single round of PCR. The proposed modular design also incorporates features allowing streamlined insertion mapping without repeated optimization. Furthermore, we have presented evidence that efficient L1 retrotransposition is not dependent on pCEP4 conferred autonomous replication capabilities when a shortened puromycin selection protocol is used, providing a great opportunity for further optimization of L1 cell culture assay vectors by using alternative vector backbones.

So far biologists identified two necessary conditions for bistability: positive feedback and ultrasensitivity. Results: Biological systems are based upon elementary mono- and bimolecular chemical reactions. In order to definitely clarify all necessary conditions for bistability we here present the corresponding minimal system. According to our definition, it contains the minimal number of (i) reactants, (ii) reactions, and (iii) terms in the corresponding ordinary differential equations (decreasing importance from i-iii). The minimal bistable system contains two reactants and four irreversible reactions (three bimolecular, one monomolecular). We discuss the roles of the reactions with respect to the necessary conditions for bistability: two reactions comprise the positive feedback loop, a third reaction filters out small stimuli thus enabling a stable 'off' state, and the fourth reaction prevents explosions. We argue that prevention of explosion is a third general necessary condition for bistability, which is so far lacking discussion in the literature. Moreover, in addition to proving that in two-component systems three steady states are necessary for bistability (five for tristability, etc.), we also present a simple general method to design such systems: one just needs one production and three different degradation mechanisms (one production, five degradations for tristability, etc.). This helps modelling multistable systems and it is important for corresponding synthetic biology projects. Conclusion: The presented minimal bistable system finally clarifies the often discussed question for the necessary conditions for bistability. The three necessary conditions are: positive feedback, a mechanism to filter out small stimuli and a mechanism to prevent explosions. This is important for modelling bistability with simple systems and for synthetically designing new bistable systems. Our simple model system is also well suited for corresponding teaching purposes."}},{"pk": "6650", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "5", "pubYear": 2009, "doi": "10.1002/smll.200900667", "sbw": 0, "title": "A Self-Assembled Protein Nanotube with High Aspect Ratio", "pubMonth": "9", "journal": 1830, "abstract": "Production of a self-assembled protein nanotube achieved through engineering of the 11mer ring protein trp RNA-binding attenuation protein is described.

The ortho substituents of these nucleotides are included to facilitate unnatural base pair extension, presumably by forming a hydrogen-bond with the polymerase, but the synthesis of the unnatural base pair still requires optimization. Recently, we have shown that meta and/or para substituents within the dMMO2 scaffold can facilitate unnatural base pair synthesis, although the mechanism remains unclear. To explore this issue, we synthesized and evaluated several dMMO2 derivatives with meta-chlorine, -bromine, -iodine, -methyl, or -propinyl substituents. Complete characterization of unnatural base pair and mispair synthesis and extension reveal that the modifications have large effects only on the efficiency of unnatural base pair synthesis and that the effects likely result from a combination of changes in steric interactions, polarity, and polarizability. The results also suggest that functionalized versions of the propinyl moiety of d5PrM should serve as suitable linkers to site-specifically incorporate other chemical functionalities into DNA.

This technique, termed promoter swapping, involves the creation of a PCR product that encodes a removable antibiotic resistance cassette and an engineered promoter. Short homology sequences on the ends of the PCR fragment target it for homologous recombination with the chromosome catalyzed by phage-derived recombination proteins. After the PCR product is introduced by electroporation into an appropriate acceptor strain, antibiotic resistance selects the desired recombination products. The antibiotic resistance cassette is then removed from the strain by site-specific recombination leaving the engineered promoter precisely positioned upstream of a target gene but downstream of a short scar consisting of a single site-specific recombination site."}},{"pk": "6922", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "143", "pubYear": 2009, "doi": "10.1039/b901610d", "sbw": 1, "title": "Rational design of peptide-based building blocks for nanoscience and synthetic biology", "pubMonth": "0", "journal": 6921, "abstract": "The rational design of peptides that fold to form discrete nanoscale objects, and/or self-assemble into nanostructured materials is an exciting challenge.

Coiled coils are based on interacting alpha-helices, and guide and cement many protein-protein interactions in nature.

However, the development of synthetic gene networks is still difficult and most newly created gene networks are non-functioning due to intrinsic parameter uncertainties, external disturbances and functional variations of intra- and extra-cellular environments. The design method for a robust synthetic gene network that works properly in a host cell under these intrinsic parameter uncertainties and external disturbances is the most important topic in synthetic biology. Results: In this study, we propose a stochastic model that includes parameter fluctuations and external disturbances to mimic the dynamic behaviors of a synthetic gene network in the host cell. Then, based on this stochastic model, four design specifications are introduced to guarantee that a synthetic gene network can achieve its desired steady state behavior in spite of parameter fluctuations, external disturbances and functional variations in the host cell. We propose a systematic method to select a set of appropriate design parameters for a synthetic gene network that will satisfy these design specifications so that the intrinsic parameter fluctuations can be tolerated, the external disturbances can be efficiently filtered, and most importantly, the desired steady states can be achieved. Thus the synthetic gene network can work properly in a host cell under intrinsic parameter uncertainties, external disturbances and functional variations. Finally, a design procedure for the robust synthetic gene network is developed and a design example is given in silico to confirm the performance of the proposed method. Conclusion: Based on four design specifications, a systematic design procedure is developed for designers to engineer a robust synthetic biology network that can achieve its desired steady state behavior under parameter fluctuations, external disturbances and functional variations in the host cell. Therefore, the proposed systematic design method has good potential for the robust synthetic gene network design."}},{"pk": "6942", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "25", "pubYear": 2009, "doi": "10.1093/bioinformatics/btp401", "sbw": 0, "title": "Antimony: a modular model definition language", "pubMonth": "9", "journal": 1171, "abstract": "Motivation: Model exchange in systems and synthetic biology has been standardized for computers with the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) and CellML, but specialized software is needed for the generation of models in these formats.

The most prominent representation of synthetic biology has so far been microbial engineering by recombinant DNA technology, employing modular concepts known from information technology. However, there are an increasing number of biophysical groups who follow similar strategies of dissecting cellular processes and networks, trying to identify functional minimal modules that could then be combined in a bottom-up approach towards biology. These modules are so far not as particularly defined by their impact on DNA processing, but rather influenced by core fields of biophysics, such as cell mechanics and membrane dynamics.

Because of this, their performance is determined by the tradeoff inherent to their switching thermodynamics, while a switching equilibrium constant favoring the nonbinding, nonsignaling, conformation ensures a larger signal change (more molecules are poised to respond), it also reduces affinity (binding must overcome a more unfavorable conformational free energy). We then derive and employ the relationship between switching thermodynamics and switch signaling to rationally tune the dynamic range and detection limit of a representative structure-switching biosensor, a molecular beacon, over 4 orders of magnitude. These findings demonstrate that the performance of biomolecular switches can be rationally tuned via mutations that alter their switching thermodynamics and suggest a mechanism by which the performance of naturally occurring switches may have evolved."}},{"pk": "7047", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "48", "pubYear": 2009, "doi": "10.1002/anie.200902182", "sbw": 1, "title": "Microfluidic Formation of Monodisperse, Cell-Sized, and Unilamellar Vesicles", "pubMonth": "0", "journal": 1243, "abstract": ""}},{"pk": "7076", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "4", "pubYear": 2009, "doi": "10.1021/cb900109w", "sbw": 1, "title": "A Synthetic Protein Selected for Ligand Binding Affinity Mediates ATP Hydrolysis", "pubMonth": "8", "journal": 2923, "abstract": "How primitive enzymes emerged from a primordial pool remains a fundamental uranswered question with Important practical implications in synthetic biology.

Structural insights into this reaction,were obtained by growing protein crystals under saturating ATP conditions. The resulting crystal structure refined to 1.8 angstrom resolution reveals that this man-made, protein binds ATP in an unusual bent conformation that is metal-independent and held in place by a key bridging water molecule. Removal of this Interaction using a null mutant results in a variant that binds ATP in a normal linear geometry and is incapable of ATP hydrolysis. Biochemical analysis, including high-resolution mass spectrometry performed on dissolved protein crystals, confirms that the reaction Is accelerated in the crystalline environment.

It is implied that such a system with interlinked positive and negative feedback loops is a flexible motif that can modulate itself among various functions. Here, we developed a minimal model for the system and systematically explored its dynamics and performance advantage in response to stimuli in a unifying framework. The system indeed displays diverse behaviors when the strength of feedback loops is changed. First, the system can be tunable from monostability to bistability by increasing the strength of positive feedback, and the bistability regime is modulated by the strength of negative feedback. Second, the system undergoes transitions from bistability to excitability and to oscillation with increasing the strength of negative feedback, and the reverse conversion occurs by enhancing the strength of positive feedback. Third, the system is more flexible than a single feedback loop, it can produce robust larger-amplitude oscillations over a wider stimulus regime compared with a single time-delayed negative feedback loop. Furthermore, the tunability of the system depends mainly on the topology of coupled feedback loops but less on the exact parameter values or the mode of interactions between model components. Thus, our results interpret why such a system represents a tunable motif and can accomplish various functions.

In this paper, we further explore the plausibility of this 'RNA world' scenario and show, through synthetic molecular design guided by advanced RNA simulations, that RNA can also perform elementary regulation tasks on its own. We demonstrate that RNA synthetic regulatory modules directly inspired from bacterial transcription attenuators can efficiently activate or repress the expression of other RNA by merely controlling their folding paths 'on the fly' during transcription through simple RNA-RNA antisense interaction. Factors, such as NTP concentration and RNA synthesis rate, affecting the efficiency of this kinetic regulation mechanism are also studied and discussed in the light of evolutionary constraints. Overall, this suggests that direct coupling among synthesis, folding and regulation of RNAs may have enabled the early emergence of autonomous RNA-based regulation networks in absence of both DNA and protein partners."}},{"pk": "7449", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "37", "pubYear": 2009, "doi": "10.1093/nar/gkp361", "sbw": 11, "title": "Writing DNA with GenoCAD (TM)", "pubMonth": "7", "journal": 1871, "abstract": "Chemical synthesis of custom DNA made to order calls for software streamlining the design of synthetic DNA sequences.

The canonical system consists of a membrane-bound sensor histidine kinase that autophosphorylates in response to a signal and transfers the phosphate to an intracellular response regulator. Bacteria typically have dozens of two-component systems. The key questions are whether these systems are linear and, if they are, how cross talk between systems is buffered. In this work, we studied the EnvZ/OmpR and CpxA/CpxR systems from Escherichia coli, which have been shown previously to exhibit slow cross talk in vitro. Using in vitro radiolabeling and a rapid quenched-flow apparatus, we experimentally measured 10 biochemical parameters capturing the cognate and non-cognate phosphotransfer reactions between the systems. These data were used to parameterize a mathematical model that was used to predict how cross talk is affected as different genes are knocked out. It was predicted that significant cross talk between EnvZ and CpxR only occurs for the triple mutant Delta ompR Delta cpxA Delta actA-pta. All seven combinations of these knockouts were made to test this prediction and only the triple mutant demonstrated significant cross talk, where the cpxP promoter was induced 280-fold upon the activation of EnvZ. Furthermore, the behavior of the other knockouts agrees with the model predictions. These results support a kinetic model of buffering where both the cognate bifunctional phosphatase activity and the competition between regulator proteins for phosphate prevent cross talk in vivo.

Perhaps the most important aspect of modelling is to follow a clear design methodology that will help to highlight unwanted deficiencies. The use of tools designed to aid the modelling process can be of benefit in many situations. In this paper, the modelling approach called systemic computation (SC) is introduced. SC is an interaction-based language, which enables individual-based expression and modelling of biological systems, and the interactions between them. SC permits a precise description of a hypothetical mechanism to be written using an intuitive graph-based or a calculus-based notation. The same description can then be directly run as a simulation, merging the hypothetical mechanism and the simulation into the same entity. However, even when using well-designed modelling tools to produce good models, the best model is not always the most accurate one. Frequently, computational constraints or lack of data make it infeasible to model an aspect of biology. Simplification may provide one way forward, but with inevitable consequences of decreased accuracy. Instead of attempting to replace an element with a simpler approximation, it is sometimes possible to substitute the element with a different but functionally similar component. In the second part of this paper, this modelling approach is described and its advantages are summarized using an exemplar: the fractal protein model.

Attempts to transfer biomass-degrading capability to industrially useful organisms by heterologous expression of one or a few biomass-degrading enzymes have met with limited success. It seems probable that an effective biomass-degradation system requires the synergistic action of a large number of enzymes, the individual and collective actions of which are poorly understood. By offering the ability to combine any number of transgenes in a modular, combinatorial way, synthetic biology offers a new approach to elucidating the synergistic action of combinations of biomass-degrading enzymes in vivo and may ultimately lead to a transferable biomass-degradation system.

A goal of synthetic biology is to rewire natural signal transduction systems. Bacteria, yeast, and plants sense environmental aspects through conserved histidine kinase (HK) signal transduction systems. HK protein components are typically comprised of multiple, relatively modular, and conserved domains. Phosphate transfer between these components may exhibit considerable cross talk between the otherwise apparently linear pathways, thereby establishing networks that integrate multiple signals. We show that sequence conservation and cross talk can extend across kingdoms and can be exploited to produce a synthetic plant signal transduction system. In response to HK cross talk, heterologously expressed bacterial response regulators, PhoB and OmpR, translocate to the nucleus on HK activation. Using this discovery, combined with modification of PhoB (PhoB-VP64), we produced a key component of a eukaryotic synthetic signal transduction pathway. In response to exogenous cytokinin, PhoB-VP64 translocates to the nucleus, binds a synthetic PlantPho promoter, and activates gene expression. These results show that conserved-signaling components can be used across kingdoms and adapted to produce synthetic eukaryotic signal transduction pathways.

We also showed that uncoupling of the active sites could be achieved by mutagenesis or deletion of the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate synthase site and that this leads to accumulation of intracellular formaldehyde.

Production of the repressor proteins is often limited due to inhibiting effects on the production host and requires iterative process optimization for each individual repressor. At the example of the Streptomyces pristinaespiralis-derived streptogramin-dependent repressor PIP, the expression of which was shown to inhibit growth of Escherichia coli BL21*, we demonstrate that the addition of the PIP-specific streptogramin antibiotic pristinamycin I neutralizes the growth-inhibiting effect and results in >100-fold increased PIP titers. The yield of PIP was further increased 2.5-fold by the engineering of a new E coli host suitable for the production of growth-inhibiting proteins encoded by an unfavorable codon usage. PIP produced in the presence of pristinamycin I was purified and was shown to retain the antibiotic-dependent binding to its operator pir as demonstrated by a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based approach. At the example of the macrolide, tetracycline- and arsenic-dependent repressors MphR(A), TetR and ArsR, we further demonstrate that the production yields can be increased 2- to 3-fold by the addition of the cognate inducer molecules erythromycin, tetracycline and As3+, respectively. Therefore, the addition of inducer molecules specific to the target repressor protein seems to be a general strategy to increase the yield of this interesting protein class. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

We design and implement compact, orthogonal gene expression networks. In particular we focus on creating transcription-translation feed-forward loops (FFLs). The transcription-translation FFLs reported cannot be created by using the cells' gene expression machinery and introduce information-processing delays on the order of hours into gene expression. We refactor the rRNA operon, uncoupling the synthesis of the orthogonal 16S rRNA for the O-ribosome from the synthesis and processing of the rest of the rRNA operon, thereby defining a minimal module that can be added to the cell for O-ribosome production. The minimal O-ribosome permits the rational alteration of the delay in an orthogonal gene expression FFL.

The Gibbs free energies of formation and reaction are estimated for 914 compounds (81%) and 902 reactions (75%), respectively, in the database. The reactions are classified based on the minimum and maximum Gibbs free energy values, which accounts for uncertainty in the free energy estimates and a feasible concentration range relevant to biodegradation.

In this article, we experimentally tested whether this relationship could be used to engineer novel DNAprotein interactions. Using Escherichia coli CRP as a template, we tested eight designs based on this relationship and found that four worked as predicted. Collectively, these results in this work demonstrate that comparative genomics can inform the design of bacterial transcription factors."}},{"pk": "8484", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "27", "pubYear": 2009, "doi": "10.1038/nbt.1536", "sbw": 32, "title": "Diversity-based, model-guided construction of synthetic gene networks with predicted functions", "pubMonth": "5", "journal": 1368, "abstract": "Engineering artificial gene networks from modular components is a major goal of synthetic biology.

This is the aim of the present work, in particular, we examined the question of the minimal physical size of cells using liposomes that entrapped the complete ribosomal machinery for expression of enhanced green fluorescence protein, and we made the assumption that this size would also correspond to a full fledged cell. We found that liposomes with a radius of about 100 nm, which is the smallest size ever considered in the literature for protein expression, are still capable of protein expression, and surprisingly, the average yield of fluorescent protein in the liposomes was 6.1-times higher than in bulk water. This factor would become even larger if one would refer only to the fraction of liposomes that are fully viable, which are those that contain all the molecular components (about 80). The observation of viable liposomes, which must contain all macromolecular components, indeed represents a conundrum. In fact, classic statistical analysis would give zero or negligible probability for the simultaneous entrapment of so many different molecular components in one single 100 nm radius spherical compartment at the given bulk concentration. The agreement between theoretical statistical predictions and experimental data is possible with the assumption that the concentration of solutes in the liposomes becomes larger by at least a factor twenty. Further investigation is required to understand the over-concentration mechanism, and to identify the several biophysical factors that could play a role in the observed activity enhancement. We conclude by suggesting that these entrapment effects in small-sized compartments, once validated, might be very relevant in the origin-of-life scenario."}},{"pk": "8528", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "17", "pubYear": 2009, "doi": "10.1016/j.bmc.2009.03.047", "sbw": 0, "title": "2 '-Deoxy-1-methylpseudocytidine, a stable analog of 2 '-deoxy-5-methylisocytidine", "pubMonth": "5", "journal": 8527, "abstract": "2 '-Deoxy-5-methylisocytidine is widely used in assays to personalize the care of patients infected with HIV, hepatitis C, and other infectious agents.

The properties of three element interlocked positive feedback loops that embeds both mutual activation and inhibition are studied in depth for their bistable properties by performing bifurcation and stochastic simulations. Codimension one and two bifurcations reveal important properties like robustness to parameter variations and adaptability under various conditions by its ability to fine tune the threshold to a wide range of values and to maintain a wide bistable regime. Furthermore, we show that in the interlocked circuit, mutual inhibition controls the decision to switch from OFF to ON state, while mutual activation enforces the decision. This view is supported through a concrete biological example Candida albicans, a human fungal pathogen that can exist in two distinctive cell types: one in the default white state and the other in an opaque form. Stochastic switching between these two forms takes place due to the epigenetic alternation induced by the transcriptional regulators in the circuit, albeit without any rearrangement of the nuclear chromosomes. The transcriptional regulators constitute interlocked mutual activation and inhibition feedback circuits that provide adaptable threshold and wide bistable regime. These positive feedback loops are shown to be responsible for robust noise induced transitions without chattering, persistence of particular phenotypes for many generations and selective exhibition of one particular form of phenotype when Mutated. Finally, we propose for synthetic biology constructs to use interlocked positive feedback loops instead of two element positive feedback loops because they are better controlled than isolated mutual activation and mutual inhibition feedback circuits.

We have chosen vitamin H, also known as biotin, to control target gene transcription in mammalian cells in a potentially side effect-free manner. BirA, the Escherichia coli repressor of the biotin biosynthesis operon, was fused to the Herpes simplex transactivation domain to generate a biotin-dependent transactivator (BIT), which, in the presence of biotin, binds and activates chimeric target promoters (PBIT) harboring BirA-specific operator sites 50 of a minimal promoter.

Time delays are common and substantial in these biochemical processes due to gene transcription, translation, posttranslation protein modification and diffusion. Molecular noises in gene networks come from intrinsic fluctuations, transmitted noise from upstream genes, and the global noise affecting all genes. Knowledge of molecular noise filtering and biochemical process delay compensation in gene networks is crucial to understand the signal processing in gene networks and the design of noise-tolerant and delay-robust gene circuits for synthetic biology. Results: A nonlinear stochastic dynamic model with multiple time delays is proposed for describing a gene network under process delays, intrinsic molecular fluctuations, and extrinsic molecular noises. Then, the stochastic biochemical processing scheme of gene regulatory networks for attenuating these molecular noises and compensating process delays is investigated from the nonlinear signal processing perspective. In order to improve the robust stability for delay toleration and noise filtering, a robust gene circuit for nonlinear stochastic time-delay gene networks is engineered based on the nonlinear robust H-infinity stochastic filtering scheme. Further, in order to avoid solving these complicated noise-tolerant and delay-robust design problems, based on Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy time-delay model and linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) technique, a systematic gene circuit design method is proposed to simplify the design procedure.

Current systems biology has accumulated much data on mutations with large effects and can predict the properties of knockout mutants in some systems. However experimental methods are too insensitive to observe small effects. Results: Here I propose a novel framework that brings together evolutionary theory and current systems biology approaches in order to quantify small effects of mutations and their epistatic interactions in silico. Central to this approach is the definition of fitness correlates that can be computed in some current systems biology models employing the rigorous algorithms that are at the core of much work in computational systems biology. The framework exploits synergies between the realism of such models and the need to understand real systems in evolutionary theory. This framework can address many longstanding topics in evolutionary biology by defining various 'levels' of the adaptive landscape. Addressed topics include the distribution of mutational effects on fitness, as well as the nature of advantageous mutations, epistasis and robustness. Combining corresponding parameter estimates with population genetics models raises the possibility of testing evolutionary hypotheses at a new level of realism. Conclusion: EvoSysBio is expected to lead to a more detailed understanding of the fundamental principles of life by combining knowledge about well-known biological systems from several disciplines. This will benefit both evolutionary theory and current systems biology.

In order to process this large amount of information, Systems Biology shows that a central role is played by regulatory networks composed of genes and proteins. The objective of this paper is to present and to discuss simple regulatory network motifs having the property to maximize their responses under time-periodic stimulations. In elucidating the mechanisms underlying these responses through simple networks the goal is to pinpoint general principles which optimize the oscillatory responses of molecular networks. Results: We took a look at basic network motifs studied in the literature such as the Incoherent Feedforward Loop (IFFL) or the interlerlocked negative feedback loop. The former is also generalized to a diamond pattern, with network components being either purely genetic or combining genetic and signaling pathways. Using standard mathematics and numerical simulations, we explain the types of responses exhibited by the IFFL with respect to a train of periodic pulses. We show that this system has a non-vanishing response only if the inter-pulse interval is above a threshold. A slight generalisation of the IFFL (the diamond) is shown to work as an ideal pass-band filter. We next show a mechanism by which average of oscillatory response can be maximized by bursting temporal patterns. Finally we study the interlerlocked negative feedback loop, i.e. a 2-gene motif forming a loop where the nodes respectively activate and repress each other, and show situations where this system possesses a resonance under periodic stimulation. Conclusion: We present several simple motif designs of molecular networks producing optimal output in response to periodic stimulations of the system. The identified mechanisms are simple and based on known network motifs in the literature, so that that they could be embodied in existing organisms, or easily implementable by means of synthetic biology.

Tomato fruit and its products contain the potent antioxidant lycopene and are the predominant source of lycopene in the human diet.

The presence of other health promoting phytochemicals such as tocopherols and flavonoids in tomato has led to tomato and its products being termed a functional food. Over the past decade genetic/metabolic engineering of carotenoid biosynthesis and accumulation has resulted in the generation of transgenic varieties containing high lycopene and beta-carotene contents. In achieving this important goal many fundamental lessons have been learnt. Most notably is the observation that the endogenous carotenoid pathways in higher plants appear to resist engineered changes. Typically, this resistance manifests itself through intrinsic regulatory mechanisms that are \"silent\" until manipulation of the pathway is initiated.

In addition, we demonstrate that engineered bacteriophage can enhance the killing of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, persister cells, and biofilm cells, reduce the number of antibiotic-resistant bacteria that arise from an antibiotic-treated population, and act as a strong adjuvant for other bactericidal antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides and beta-lactams). Furthermore, we show that engineering bacteriophage to target non-SOS gene networks and to overexpress multiple factors also can produce effective antibiotic adjuvants. This work establishes a synthetic biology platform for the rapid translation and integration of identified targets into effective antibiotic adjuvants."}},{"pk": "8935", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "37", "pubYear": 2009, "doi": "10.1093/nar/gkp022", "sbw": 4, "title": "Model-based redesign of global transcription regulation", "pubMonth": "4", "journal": 1871, "abstract": "Synthetic biology aims to the design or redesign of biological systems.

Since many habitats containing large amounts of aromatic compounds are often anoxic, the anaerobic catabolism of aromatic compounds by microorganisms becomes crucial in biogeochemical cycles and in the sustainable development of the biosphere. The mineralization of aromatic compounds by facultative or obligate anaerobic bacteria can be coupled to anaerobic respiration with a variety of electron acceptors as well as to fermentation and anoxygenic photosynthesis. Since the redox potential of the electron-accepting system dictates the degradative strategy, there is wide biochemical diversity among anaerobic aromatic degraders. However, the genetic determinants of all these processes and the mechanisms involved in their regulation are much less studied. This review focuses on the recent findings that standard molecular biology approaches together with new high-throughput technologies (e.g., genome sequencing, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metagenomics) have provided regarding the genetics, regulation, ecophysiology, and evolution of anaerobic aromatic degradation pathways. These studies revealed that the anaerobic catabolism of aromatic compounds is more diverse and widespread than previously thought, and the complex metabolic and stress programs associated with the use of aromatic compounds under anaerobic conditions are starting to be unraveled.

One of the most ambitious research line concerns the so-called semi-synthetic minimal cells, which are liposome-based system capable of synthesizing the lipids within the liposome surface. This goal can be reached by reconstituting membrane proteins within liposomes and allow them to synthesize lipids. This approach, that can be defined as biochemical, was already reported by us (Schmidli et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 113, 8127-8130, 1991). In more advanced models, however, a full reconstruction of the biochemical pathway requires (1) the synthesis of functional membrane enzymes inside liposomes, and (2) the local synthesis of lipids as catalyzed by the in situ synthesized enzymes. Here we show the synthesis and the activity - inside liposomes - of two membrane proteins involved in phospholipids biosynthesis pathway. The proteins, sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) and lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase (LPAAT), have been synthesized by using a totally reconstructed cell-free system (PURE system) encapsulated in liposomes. The activities of internally synthesized GPAT and LPAAT were confirmed by detecting the produced lysophosphatidic acid and phosphatidic acid, respectively.

To test the effect of membrane-membrane spacing on fusion, a series of conjugates was constructed by adding 2-24 noncomplementary bases at the membrane-proximal ends of two complementary sequences. Increasing linker lengths generally resulted in progressively reduced rates and extents of lipid and content mixing, in contrast to higher vesicle docking rates. The relatively flexible, single-stranded DNA linker facilitates docking but allows greater spacing between the vesicles after docking, thus making the transition into fusion less probable, but not preventing it altogether.

I then turn to the new field of systems biology, which recognizes that traditional reductionist approaches to biology are no longer adequate and attempts to provide a more integrative understanding of biological systems.

I then turn to systems biology's sister discipline, synthetic biology, which deals with emergence by reducing the complexity of biological systems. By factoring out messy contingencies, synthetic biology is, in theory, well suited to commodification.

Using a microfluidic platform tailored for single- cell microscopy, we precisely control environmental conditions and monitor oscillations in individual cells through multiple cycles. Experiments reveal remarkable robustness and persistence of oscillations in the designed circuit, almost every cell exhibited large- amplitude fluorescence oscillations throughout observation runs. The oscillatory period can be tuned by altering inducer levels, temperature and the media source. Computational modelling demonstrates that the key design principle for constructing a robust oscillator is a time delay in the negative feedback loop, which can mechanistically arise from the cascade of cellular processes involved in forming a functional transcription factor.

This made available a total of nine unique restriction sites for engineering. The DNA for donor \"reductive loops,\" which are sets of contiguous domains comprising either KR or KR and dehydratase (DH), or KR, DH and enoylreductase (ER) domains, was cloned from selected modules of five natural PKS multienzymes and spliced into module 2 of DEBS 1-TE using alternative polylinker sites. The resulting hybrid PKSs were tested for triketide production in vivo. Most of the hybrid multienzymes were active, vindicating the treatment of the reductive loop as a single structural unit, but yields were dependent on the restriction sites used. Further, different donor reductive loops worked optimally with different splice sites. For those reductive loops comprising DH, ER and KR domains, premature TE-catalysed release of partially reduced intermediates was sometimes seen, which provided further insight into the overall stereochemistry of reduction in those modules. Analysis of loops containing KR only, which should generate stereocentres at both C-2 and C-3, revealed that the 3-hydroxy configuration (but not the 2-methyl configuration) could be altered by appropriate choice of a donor loop. The successful swapping of reductive loops provides an interesting parallel to a recently suggested pathway for the natural evolution of modular PKSs by recombination."}},{"pk": "10182", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "4", "pubYear": 2008, "doi": "10.1038/msb.2008.57", "sbw": 1, "title": "An integrated cell-free metabolic platform for protein production and synthetic biology", "pubMonth": "10", "journal": 896, "abstract": "Cell-free systems offer a unique platform for expanding the capabilities of natural biological systems for useful purposes, i.e. synthetic biology.

Genetically encoded sensors allow quantitative measurement of steady-state concentrations of ions, signaling molecules and metabolites and their respective changes over time. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensors exploit conformational changes in polypeptides as a proxy for analyte concentrations. Subtle effects of analyte binding on the conformation of the recognition element are translated into a FRET change between two fused green fluorescent protein (GFP) variants, enabling simple monitoring of analyte concentrations using fluorimetry or fluorescence microscopy. Fluorimetry provides information averaged over cell populations, while microscopy detects differences between cells or populations of cells. The genetically encoded sensors can be targeted to subcellular compartments or the cell surface.

In humans bioflms are responsible for many pathologies, most of them associated with the use of medical devices. A major problem of biofilms is their inherent tolerance to host defences and antibiotic therapies, there is therefore an urgent need to develop alternative ways to prevent and control biofilm-associated clinical infections. Several in vitro experiments have shown that phages are able to infect biofilm cells and that those phages inducing the production of depolymerases have an advantage since they can penetrate the inner layers of the biofilm by degrading components of the biofilm exopolymeric matrix. In practice clinically relevant biofilms and especially those associated with the use of medical devices can possibly be controlled for example by the topic application or the impregnation of the surface of the device with a phage solution. Another interesting approach has been the use of a phage encoding a phage polysaccharide lyase to treat Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms in cystic fibrosis patients by aerosol administration. All these strategies require prior identification of the phage and/or polysaccharide depolymerase capable of infecting the bacterial cells and degrading the polysaccharide within the biofilm, respectively. The biofilm organisms must therefore be isolated and screened against a bank of phages. This procedure is essential and raises important biotechnological challenges: the existence of a bank of phages well characterised (physiologically and genetically) whose efficacy in vivo has been tested and pharmacokinetics studied, the existence of economical and safe production protocols and purification methods (e.g. the presence of endotoxins in a phage preparation may compromise phage therapy). It is however important to consider the fact that the chances of getting a specific phage with a high lytic capability and preferential expressing a relevant exopolymer degrading enzyme is likely to be low. Genetically engineered phages can play an important role in this process. Phages can be genetically manipulated to alter their host range and to induce the production of depolymerases. It is therefore important to reinforce the application of synthetic biology to engineer phages able to efficiently degrade medical biofilms. It is also important to develop efficient methods of phage delivery and to study \"in vivo\" the phage performance against biofilms. It is still not clear how effective the biofilm can be in protecting the phages against the immune system. Efficient and economic phage production and purification protocols need also to be addressed before one can hope to use phage treatment to prevent or control infectious biofilms."}},{"pk": "10510", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "18", "pubYear": 2008, "doi": "10.1016/j.sbi.2008.06.006", "sbw": 12, "title": "Synthetic biology through biomolecular design and engineering", "pubMonth": "8", "journal": 10509, "abstract": "Synthetic biology is a rapidly growing field that has emerged in a global, multidisciplinary effort among biologists, chemists, engineers, physicists, and mathematicians.

Using this genetic selection, we created LuxI mutants with improved OHHL synthesis rates and yields through directed evolution, identifying three LuxI mutants after two generations. An in vivo semi-quantitative method allowed for verification of the genetic screen and OHHL yields were quantified using HPLC-MS/MS, revealing an 80-fold increase in a mutant culture compared to the wildtype culture. In addition to OHHL, the yields of C6HSL (hexanoyl homoserine lactone) and C8HSL (octanoyl homoserine lactone) were also improved, and a slight change in substrate specificity towards C6HSL production was observed. Based on alignment with the crystal structure of EsaI, a homolog of LuxI, two mutations are most likely involved in enhancing the interactions between the enzyme and the substrates. The high throughput genetic selection and the semi-quantitative method can be conveniently modified for the directed evolution of LuxI homologs. The identification of these LuxI mutants has implications in synthetic biology, where they can be used for the construction of artificial genetic circuits.

In both these cases, fluorescent proteins are commonly applied as a means of monitoring tire expression of genes in tire living cell, and efforts have been made to quantify protein expression levels through fluorescence intensity calibration and by monitoring the partitioning of proteins among the two daughter cells after division, such quantification is important in formulating the predictive models desired in systems and synthetic biology research. A potential pitfall of using plasmid-based gene expression systems is that the high protein levels associated with expression from plasmids can lead to the formation of inclusion bodies, insoluble aggregates of misfolded, nonfunctional proteins that will not generate fluorescence output, proteins caught in these inclusion bodies are thus \"dark\" to fluorescence-based detection methods. If significant numbers of proteins are incorporated into inclusion bodies rather than becoming biologically active, quantitative results obtained by fluorescent measurements will be skewed, we investigate this phenomenon here. We have created two plasmid constructs with differing average copy numbers, both incorporating air unregulated promoter (PLtetO-1 in tire absence of TetR) expressing the GFP derivative enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), and inserted them into Escherichia coli bacterial cells (a common model organism for work on the dynamics of prokaryotic gene expression). We extracted tire inclusion bodies, denatured them, and refolded them to reader them active, obtaining a measurement of the average number of EGFP per cell locked into these aggregates, at tire same time, we used calibrated fluorescent intensity measurements to determine the average number of active EGFP present per cell. Both measurements were carried out as a function of cellular doubling time, over a range of 45-75 min. We found that tire ratio of inclusion body EGFP to active EGFP varied strongly as a function of the cellular growth rate, and that the number of \"dark\" proteins in the aggregates could in fact be substantial, reaching ratios as high as approximately five proteins locked into inclusion bodies for every active protein (at the fastest growth rate), and dropping to ratios well below I (for the slowest growth rate).

At elevated temperatures, complex charged molecules such as nucleotides cross fatty-acid-based membranes very rapidly, suggesting that high temperature excursions may have facilitated nutrient uptake before the evolution of advanced membrane transporters.

These signals can either be cell-density related (autoinducers) or be produced by bacteria at different stages of growth, and they allow bacteria to monitor their environment and alter gene expression to derive a competitive advantage. The properties of these signals and the response elicited by them are important in ensuring bacterial survival and propagation in natural environments (e.g., human oral cavity) where hundreds of bacterial species coexist. first, the interaction between a signal and its receptor is very specific, which underlies intraspecies communication and quorum sensing. Second, when multiple signals are synthesized by the same bacterium, the signaling circuits utilized by the different signals are coordinately regulated with distinct overall circuit architecture so as to maximize the overall response. Third, the recognition of a universal communication signal synthesized by different bacterial species (interspecies communication),as well that of signals produced by eukaryotic cells (interkingdorn communication), is also integral to the formation of multispecies biofilm communities that are important in infection and disease.

We show that the presence of two calponin homology domains alone and in the context of an actin-binding domain is not sufficient for actin-binding, and that both single and homotypic type 2 calponin homology domain tandems fail to bind to actin in vitro and in transfected cells. In contrast, single and tandem type 1 calponin homology domain arrays bind actin directly but result in defective turnover rates on actin filaments, and in aberrant actin bundling when introduced into the full-length alpha-actinin molecule.

The obtained nanostructures show different morphology and stability of mixed assemblies made of COL: FLU, COL: DOX and COL: LA. The anticancer drugs appear to lead to supramolecular collagen structures with a remarkable level of nanoscale order on glass, which mimics natural protein assemblies. The obtained patterns, especially for COL: FLU biosystem, reflect a high level of internal order within the ordered molecules network. In these cases, the external order reflects high internal organization within these highly evolved systems.

This ability of anti-cancer drugs to control COL assembly brings further utility to the system as it allows additional compounds to be added to self assembly mixtures.

Using a synthetic biology approach involving the reconstruction of the putative electron transport chain of the DIR bacterium Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 in Escherichia coli, we showed that expression of cymA was necessary and sufficient to convert E. coli into a DIR bacterium. In intact cells, the Fe(III)-reducing activity was limited to Fe(III) NTA as electron acceptor. In vitro biochemical analysis indicated that CymA, which is a cytoplasmic membrane-associated tetrahaem c-type cytochrome, carries reductase activity towards Fe(III) NTA, Fe(III) citrate, as well as to AQDS, a humic acid analogue. The in vitro specific activities of Fe(III) citrate reductase and AQDS reductase of E. coli spheroplasts were 10x and 30x higher, respectively, relative to the specific rates observed in intact cells, suggesting that access of chelated and insoluble forms of Fe(III) and AQDS is restricted in whole cells. Interestingly, the E. coli CymA orthologue NapC also carried ferric reductase activity. Our data support the argument that the biochemical mechanism of Fe(III) reduction per se was not the key innovation leading to environmental relevant DIR bacteria.

The data yielded by the fluorescence output are of considerable interest in efforts to formulate quantitative models of cellular behavior underway in fields such as systems biology and synthetic biology. An often neglected aspect of these proteins, however, is their maturation: Before a fluorescent protein can generate a fluorescent signal, it must mature through a series of steps (folding, cyclization, and oxidation) that may take from many minutes to over a day. The presence of these maturation steps creates a distinction between the observed gene expression profile and the actual profile. We examine this effect through a simplified gene expression model and conclude that fluorescent protein maturation can have significant effects on estimates of both the mean protein levels and the variability in gene expression. The model shows that in many regimes, the observed variability will be increased by the maturation process, but indicates the existence of regimes in which the observed variability will actually be less than the true variability of the target protein. The latter effect arises from a low-pass filtering effect introduced by the chain of maturation reactions.

The problem is then either to guarantee that the system satisfies the expected properties for every possible parameter value-the corresponding parameter set is then called valid or to find valid subsets of a given parameter set. The proposed method uses discrete abstractions and model checking and allows for efficient search of the parameter space.

Consequently, the verification of liveness properties, expressing that something will eventually happen, and implicitly assuming progress of time, often fails.

Through the motif programming method, we have constructed an artificial protein library by mixing four peptide motifs shared among the Bcl-2 family proteins that positively or negatively regulate the apoptosis networks. We found one strong pro-apoptotic protein, d29, and two proteins having moderate, but unambiguous anti-apoptotic functions, a10 and d16, from the 28 tested clones. Thus both the pro- and anti-apoptotic modulators were present in the library, demonstrating that functional proteins with opposing effects can emerge from a single pool prepared from common motifs.

Developing countries are struggling to adjust to the heightened standards of intellectual property protection required by the TRIPS Agreement of 1994. With TRIPS, at least, these countries obtained side payments (in the form of trade concessions) to offset the rising costs of knowledge products. A free-standing instrument, such as the SPLT, would shrink the remaining flexibilities in the TRIPS Agreement with no side payments and no concessions to the catch-up strategies of developing countries at different stages of technological advancement. More controversially, we argue that a deep harmonization would boomerang against even its developed country promoters by creating more problems than it would solve. There is no vision of a properly functioning patent system for the developed world that commands even the appearance of a consensus. The evidence shows, instead, that the worldwide intellectual property system has entered a brave new scientific epoch, in which experts have only tentative, divergent ideas about how best to treat a daunting array of new technologies. The proposals for reconciling the needs of different sectors, such as information technology and biotechnology, pose hard, unresolved issues at a time when the costs of litigation are rising at the expense of profits from innovation. These difficulties are compounded by the tendency of universities to push patenting up stream, generating new rights to core methodologies and research tools. As new approaches to new technologies emerge in different jurisdictions, there is a need to gather empirical evidence to determine which, if any, of these still experimental solutions are preferable over time. Our argument need not foreclose other less intrusive options and measures surveyed in the Article that can reduce the costs of delaying harmonization. However, the international community should not rush to freeze legal obligations regarding the protection of intellectual property. It should wait until economists and policymakers better understand the dynamics of innovation and the role that patent rights play in promoting progress and until there are mechanisms in place to keep international obligations responsive to developments in science, technology, and the organization of the creative community."}},{"pk": "12407", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "3", "pubYear": 2007, "doi": "10.1039/b700547d", "sbw": 6, "title": "Engineering and applications of genetic circuits", "pubMonth": "0", "journal": 2065, "abstract": "In the field of synthetic biology, recent genetic engineering efforts have enabled the construction of novel genetic circuits with diverse functionalities and unique activation mechanisms.

From the synthetic biology viewpoint, it is also important to implement biological systems that minimizing the negative influence of the perturbations. Results: In this paper, based on systems biology approach, we provide a general theoretical result on the synchronization of genetic oscillators with stochastic perturbations. By exploiting the specific properties of many genetic oscillator models, we provide an easy-verified sufficient condition for the stochastic synchronization of coupled genetic oscillators, based on the Lur'e system approach in control theory. A design principle for minimizing the influence of noise is also presented. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results, a population of coupled repressillators is adopted as a numerical example.

The most widely used heterologous gene regulation systems are responsive to antibiotics of the tetracycline, streptogramin and macrolide classes.

We have therefore designed a strategy to convert antibiotic-responsive transcription factors into gene regulation systems responsive to non-toxic biotin, also known as vitamin H. Constitutive ligation of biotin to the Avitag-containing VP16 transactivation domain by the Escherichia coli biotin ligase BirA enables heterodimerization with tetracycline- (TetR), streptogramin- (Pip), and macrolide- (E) dependent repressors fused to streptavidin, which creates synthetic transactivators able to activate specific promoters (PhCMV*-1, P-PIR, P-ETR). We have demonstrated (i) that exogenous biotin (40 nM) can induce heterologous transgene expression in a biotin- (serum-) free culture environment (biotin-dependent heterodimerization of transactivator), (ii) that excess biotin (above 200 mu m) gradually represses transgene expression in a biotin- (serum-) containing environment (saturation of streptavidin by excess biotin prevents heterodimerization of the transactivator), and (iii) that avidin can sequestrate endogenous biotin in serum-containing cultures and so repress transgene expression in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, by engineering all off the components required for biotin-controlled transgene expression (Avitag-VP16, repressor-streptavidin, BirA) into a tricistronic (lenti)vector configuration, it was possible to transfect (transduce) a variety of mammalian cell lines and primary cells and enable biotin-controlled transgene expression in a simple and straightforward manner.

We developed a generic computational model that captured the experimentally observed differences for each of the promoters, and more detailed models to successively predict the behavior of multiple operator-containing promoters from single operator-containing promoters. Our results suggest that the independent binding of single repressors is not sufficient to explain the more complex behavior of the multiple operator-containing promoters. Taken together, our findings highlight the importance of joint experimental-computational efforts and some of the challenges of using a bottom-up approach based on well characterized, isolated biomolecular components for predicting the behavior of complex, synthetic gene networks, e.g., the whole can be different from the sum of its parts."}},{"pk": "12821", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "37", "pubYear": 2007, "doi": "10.1007/s11084-007-9095-0", "sbw": 2, "title": "Biosynthesis of phosphatidic acid in liposome compartments - Toward the self-reproduction of minimal cells", "pubMonth": "10", "journal": 4522, "abstract": "Self-reproduction is one of main properties that define living cells.

The minimal cells approach consists in the investigation of the minimal number of elements to accomplish simple cell-like processes - like self-reproduction. Such approach belongs to the field of synthetic biology. The minimal cells are reconstructed from a totally reconstituted cell-free protein synthesis system (PURESYSTEM) and liposome compartments as containers. Based on this approach, we synthesized two membrane proteins (enzymes), GPAT and LPAAT, which are involved in the phosphatidic acid biosynthesis in bacteria. Both membrane proteins were successfully synthesized by PURESYSTEM encapsulated inside POPC liposomes. Additionally, the enzymatic activity of GPAT was restored by mixing the expressed enzyme with lipid and by forming liposomes in situ.

The second promoter controls the amber suppressor tRNA supD. When both components are transcribed, T7 RNA polymerase is synthesized and this in turn activates a T7 promoter. Because inputs and outputs are promoters, the design is modular, that is, it can be reconnected to integrate different input signals and the output can be used to drive different cellular responses.

The past 5 years has thus seen the design and construction of the first synthetic mammalian gene regulatory networks. These networks have built upon pioneering advances in prokaryotic synthetic networks and possess an impressive range of functionalities that will some day enable the engineering of sophisticated inter- and intra-cellular functions to become a reality. At a relatively simple level, the modular linking of transcriptional components has enabled the creation of genetic networks that are strongly analogous to the architectural design and functionality of electronic circuits. Thus, by combining components in different serial or parallel configurations it is possible to produce networks that follow strict logic in integrating multiple independent signals (logic gates and transcriptional cascades) or which temporally modify input signals (time-delay circuits). Progressing in terms of sophistication, synthetic transcriptional networks have also been constructed which emulate naturally occurring genetic properties, such as bistability or dynamic instability. Toggle switches which possess \"memory\" so as to remember transient administered inputs, hysteric switches which are resistant to stochastic fluctuations in inputs, and oscillatory networks which produce regularly timed expression outputs, are all examples of networks that have been constructed using such properties. Initial steps have also been made in designing the above networks to respond not only to exogenous signals, but also endogenous signals that may be associated with aberrant cellular function or physiology thereby providing a means for tightly controlled gene therapy applications. Moving beyond pure transcriptional control, synthetic networks have also been created which utilize phenomena, such as post-transcriptional silencing, translational control, or inter-cellular signaling to produce novel network-based control both within and between cells. It is envisaged in the not-too-distant future that these networks will provide the basis for highly sophisticated genetic manipulations in biopharmaceutical manufacturing, gene therapy and tissue engineering applications.

Three examples of this 'chemical synthetic biology' approach are given in this article. The first example deals with the synthesis of proteins that do not exist in nature, and dubbed as 'the never born proteins' (NBPs). This research is related to the question why and how the protein structures existing in our world have been selected out, with the underlying question whether they have something very particular from the structural or thermodynamic point of view (for example, the folding). The NBPs are produced in the laboratory by the modern molecular biology technique, the phage display, so as to produce a very large library of proteins having no homology with known proteins. The second example of chemical synthetic biology has also to do with the laboratory synthesis of proteins, but, this time, adopting a prebiotic synthetic procedure, the fragment condensation of short peptides, where short means that they have a length that can be obtained by prebiotic methods for example, from the condensation of N-carboxy anhydrides. The scheme is illustrated and discussed, being based on the fragment condensation catalyzed by peptides endowed with proteolitic activity. Selection during chain growth is determined by solubility under the contingent environmental conditions, i.e., the peptides which result insoluble are eliminated from further growth. The scheme is tested preliminarily with a synthetic chemical fragment-condensation method and brings to the synthesis of a 44-residueslong protein, which has no homology with known proteins, and which has a stable tertiary folding. Finally, the third example, dubbed as 'the minimal cell project'. Here, the aim is to synthesize a cell model having the minimal and sufficient number of components to be defined as living. For this purpose, liposomes are used as shell membranes, and attempts are made to introduce in the interior a minimal genome.

Much of this diversity is mediated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs) that activate Rho family GTPases - the master regulators of the actin cytoskeleton(1-3). There are over 80 Rho GEFs in the human genome ( compared to only 22 genes for the Rho GTPases themselves), and the evolution of new and diverse GEFs is thought to provide a mechanism for linking the core cytoskeletal machinery to a wide range of new control inputs. Here we test this hypothesis and ask if we can systematically reprogramme cellular morphology by engineering synthetic GEF proteins. We focused on Dbl family Rho GEFs, which have a highly modular structure common to many signalling proteins(4,5): they contain a catalytic Dbl homology (DH) domain linked to diverse regulatory domains, many of which autoinhibit GEF activity(2,3). Here we show that by recombining catalytic GEF domains with new regulatory modules, we can generate synthetic GEFs that are activated by non-native inputs. We have used these synthetic GEFs to reprogramme cellular behaviour in diverse ways. The GEFs can be used to link specific cytoskeletal responses to normally unrelated upstream signalling pathways. In addition, multiple synthetic GEFs can be linked as components in series to form an artificial cascade with improved signal processing behaviour. These results show the high degree of evolutionary plasticity of this important family of modular signalling proteins, and indicate that it may be possible to use synthetic biology approaches to manipulate the complex spatio-temporal control of cell morphology."}},{"pk": "13179", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "5", "pubYear": 2007, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pbio.0050058", "sbw": 2, "title": "Synthetic biology: Caught between property rights, the public domain, and the commons", "pubMonth": "3", "journal": 3069, "abstract": ""}},{"pk": "13186", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "7", "pubYear": 2007, "doi": "10.1186/1472-6750-7-16", "sbw": 1, "title": "Engineering proteinase K using machine learning and synthetic genes", "pubMonth": "3", "journal": 13185, "abstract": "Background: Altering a protein's function by changing its sequence allows natural proteins to be converted into useful molecular tools. Current protein engineering methods are limited by a lack of high throughput physical or computational tests that can accurately predict protein activity under conditions relevant to its final application. Here we describe a new synthetic biology approach to protein engineering that avoids these limitations by combining high throughput gene synthesis with machine learning-based design algorithms. Results: We selected 24 amino acid substitutions to make in proteinase K from alignments of homologous sequences. We then designed and synthesized 59 specific proteinase K variants containing different combinations of the selected substitutions. The 59 variants were tested for their ability to hydrolyze a tetrapeptide substrate after the enzyme was first heated to 68 C for 5 minutes. Sequence and activity data was analyzed using machine learning algorithms. This analysis was used to design a new set of variants predicted to have increased activity over the training set, that were then synthesized and tested. By performing two cycles of machine learning analysis and variant design we obtained 20-fold improved proteinase K variants while only testing a total of 95 variant enzymes. Conclusion: The number of protein variants that must be tested to obtain significant functional improvements determines the type of tests that can be performed. Protein engineers wishing to modify the property of a protein to shrink tumours or catalyze chemical reactions under industrial conditions have until now been forced to accept high throughput surrogate screens to measure protein properties that they hope will correlate with the functionalities that they intend to modify. By reducing the number of variants that must be tested to fewer than 100, machine learning algorithms make it possible to use more complex and expensive tests so that only protein properties that are directly relevant to the desired application need to be measured. Protein design algorithms that only require the testing of a small number of variants represent a significant step towards a generic, resource-optimized protein engineering process."}},{"pk": "13199", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "7", "pubYear": 2007, "doi": "10.1002/pmic.200600442", "sbw": 3, "title": "The extant core bacterial proteorne is an archive of the origin of life", "pubMonth": "3", "journal": 13198, "abstract": "Genes consistently present in a clique of genomes, preferring the leading DNA strands are deemed persistent.

We have constructed a synthetic mammalian gene network that processes four different input signals to control either immediate or time-delayed transcription of specific target genes. BirA-mediated ligation of biotin to a biotinylation signal-containing VP16 transactivation domain triggers heterodimerization of chimeric VP16 to a streptavidin-linked tetracycline repressor (TetR). At increasing biotin concentrations up to 20 nM, TetR-specific promoters are gradually activated (off to on, input signal 1), are maximally induced at concentrations between 20 nM and 10 mu M, and are adjustably shut off at biotin levels exceeding 10 mu M (on to off, input signal 2). These specific expression characteristics with a discrete biotin concentration window emulate a biotin-triggered bandpass filter. Removal of biotin from the culture environment (input signal 3) results in time-delayed transgene expression until the intracellular biotinylated VP16 pool is degraded. Because the TetR component of the chimeric transactivator retains its tetracycline responsiveness, addition of this antibiotic (input signal 4) overrides biotin control and immediately shuts off target gene expression. Biotin-responsive immediate, bandpass filter, and time-delay transcription characteristics were predicted by a computational model and have been validated in standard cultivation settings or biopharmaceutical manufacturing scenarios using trangenic CHO-K1 cell derivatives and have been confirmed in mice.

Such diversity makes the ability to create and control cooperation desirable for potential applications in areas as varied as agriculture, pollutant treatment, and medicine.

Specifically, we report the construction of a synthetic obligatory cooperative system, termed CoSMO (cooperation that is synthetic and mutually obligatory), which consists of a pair of nonmating yeast strains, each supplying an essential metabolite to the other strain. The behavior of the two strains in isolation, however, revealed unintended constraints that restrict cooperation, such as asymmetry in starvation tolerance and delays in nutrient release until near cell death. However, the joint system is shown mathematically and experimentally to be viable over a wide range of initial conditions, with oscillating population ratio settling to a value predicted by nutrient supply and consumption. Unexpectedly, even in the absence of explicitly engineered mechanisms to stabilize cooperation, the cooperative system can consistently develop increased ability to survive reductions in population density. Extending synthetic biology from the design of genetic circuits to the engineering of ecological interactions, CoSMO provides a quantitative system for linking processes at the cellular level to the collective behavior at the system level, as well as a genetically tractable system for studying the evolution of cooperation."}},{"pk": "13435", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "21", "pubYear": 2007, "doi": "10.1101/gad.1507207", "sbw": 28, "title": "Designing biological systems", "pubMonth": "2", "journal": 745, "abstract": "The design of artificial biological systems and the understanding of their natural counterparts are key objectives of the emerging discipline of synthetic biology.

SARS-CoV is a zoonotic virus that crossed the species barrier, most likely originating from bats or from other species including civets, raccoon dogs, domestic cats, swine, and rodents. A SARS-CoV vaccine should confer long-term protection, especially in vulnerable senescent populations, against both the 2003 epidemic strains and zoonotic strains that may yet emerge from animal reservoirs. We report the comprehensive investigation of SARS vaccine efficacy in young and senescent mice following homologous and heterologous challenge. Methods and Findings Using Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles (VRP) expressing the 2003 epidemic Urbani SARS-CoV strain spike (S) glycoprotein (VRP-S) or the nucleocapsid (N) protein from the same strain (VRP-N), we demonstrate that VRP-S, but not VRP-N vaccines provide complete short-and long-term protection against homologous strain challenge in young and senescent mice. To test VRP vaccine efficacy against a heterologous SARS-CoV, we used phylogenetic analyses, synthetic biology, and reverse genetics to construct a chimeric virus (icGDO3-S) encoding a synthetic S glycoprotein gene of the most genetically divergent human strain, GDO3, which clusters among the zoonotic SARS-CoV. icGD03-S replicated efficiently in human airway epithelial cells and in the lungs of young and senescent mice, and was highly resistant to neutralization with antisera directed against the Urbani strain. Although VRP-S vaccines provided complete short-term protection against heterologous icGD03-S challenge in young mice, only limited protection was seen in vaccinated senescent animals. VRP-N vaccines not only failed to protect from homologous or heterologous challenge, but resulted in enhanced immunopathology with eosinophilic infiltrates within the lungs of SARS-CoV challenged mice. VRP-N-induced pathology presented at day 4, peaked around day 7, and persisted through day 14, and was likely mediated by cellular immune responses. Conclusions This study identifies gaps and challenges in vaccine design for controlling future SARS-CoV zoonosis, especially in vulnerable elderly populations. The availability of a SARS-CoV virus bearing heterologous S glycoproteins provides a robust challenge inoculum for evaluating vaccine efficacy against zoonotic strains, the most likely source of future outbreaks."}},{"pk": "13501", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "29", "pubYear": 2006, "doi": "", "sbw": 0, "title": "Zinc finger proteins: An overview", "pubMonth": "0", "journal": 13500, "abstract": "Zinc finger domains are the most common DNA-binding transcription factors in which zinc (II) contributes to the structural stability of the domain.

We have designed a novel conditional transcription technology, which enables reversible induction, repression and adjustment of desired transgene expression using the clinically inert 6-hydroxy-nicotine (6HNic). The 6-hydroxy-nicotine oxidase (6HNO) repressor (HdnoR), which manages nicotine metabolism in Arthrobacter nicotinovorans pAO1 by binding to a specific operator of the 6-hydroxy-nicotine oxidase (ONIC), was fused to the Krueppel-associated box protein of the human kox-1 gene (KRAB) to create a synthetic 6HNic-dependent transsilencer (NS) that controls chimeric mammalian promoters, which are assembled by cloning tandem O-NIC operators 3' of a constitutive promoter. In the absence of 6HNic, NS binds to O-NIC and silences the constitutive promoter, which otherwise drives high-level transgene expression when the NS-O-NIC interaction stops in the presence of 6HNic. Generic NICEON technology was compatible with a variety of constitutive viral and mammalian housekeeping promoters, each of which enabled specific induced, repressed, adjusted and reversible transgene expression profiles in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1), baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) as well as in human fibrosarcoma (HT-1080) cells. NICEON also proved successful in controlling mulficistronic expression units for coordinated transcription of up to three transgenes and in the fine-tuning of transcription-translation networks, in which RNA polymerase II- and III-dependent promoters, engineered for 6HNic responsiveness, drove expression of siRNAs that triggered specific transgene knockdown.

Chlorophyll is one of the best-recognized plant pigments with an already well-developed remote imaging technology. However, chlorophyll is very abundant, with levels regulated by both genetic and environmental factors. We designed a synthetic de-greening circuit that produced rapid chlorophyll loss on perception of a specific input. With induction of the de-greening circuit, changes were remotely detected within 2 h. Analyses of multiple de-greening circuits suggested that the de-greening circuit functioned, in part, via light-dependent damage to photosystem cores and the production of reactive oxygen species. Within 24-48 h of induction, an easily recognized white phenotype resulted. Microarray analysis showed that the synthetic de-greening initiated a process largely distinct from normal chlorophyll loss in senescence.

This control strategy was theoretically shown to be superior to an equivalent but nonautogenously regulated system when based on a repressor. Although some of its advantages were later confirmed with isolated synthetic circuits, the superiority of autogenous control in natural networks remains untested. Here, we use the SOS DNA repair system of Escherichia coli, where autogenous control is part of a single-input module, as a valid model to evaluate the functional advantages and biological implications of this mechanism. We redesign the control of its master regulator, the protein LexA, so that it becomes nonautogenously controlled. We compare both systems by combining high-resolution expression measurements with mathematical modeling. We show that the stronger stability associated with the autogenous regulation prevents false triggering of the response due to transient fluctuations in the inducing signal and that this control also reduces the system recovery time at low DNA damage. Likewise, autoregulation produces responses proportional to the damage signal level. In contrast, bacteria with LexA constitutively expressed induce maximal action even for very low damage levels. This excess in response comes at a cost, because it reduces comparatively the growth rate of these cells. Our results suggest that autogenous control evolved as a strategy to optimally respond to multiple levels of input signal minimizing the costs of the response and highlights reasons why master regulators of single-input modules are mostly autorepressed."}},{"pk": "13883", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "36", "pubYear": 2006, "doi": "", "sbw": 0, "title": "Catholic critics of early synthetic biology experiments: Agostini Gemelli, Jaume Pujiula and Jean Maumus", "pubMonth": "6", "journal": 13445, "abstract": ""}},{"pk": "13889", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "24", "pubYear": 2006, "doi": "10.1038/nbt1226", "sbw": 30, "title": "Combinatorial engineering of intergenic regions in operons tunes expression of multiple genes", "pubMonth": "8", "journal": 1368, "abstract": "Many applications of synthetic biology require the balanced expression of multiple genes.

To address the dynamical property of the positive feedback system, we employ synthetic gene circuits in Escherichia coli to measure the rise-time of both the no-feedback system and the positive feedback system. We show that the kinetics of gene expression is slowed down if the gene regulatory system includes positive feedback. We also report that the transition of gene switching behaviors from the hysteretic one to the graded one occurs. A mathematical model based on the chemical reactions shows that the response delay is an inherited property of the positive feedback system. Furthermore, with the aid of the phase diagram, we demonstrate the decline of the feedback activation causes the transition of switching behaviors.

Recent work using single cells (that are not subject to the intellectually unsupportable averaging of the variable displayed by heterogeneous cells possessing nonlinear kinetics) has led to the recognition that some protein signalling pathways may encode their signals not (just) as concentrations (AM or amplitude-modulated in a radio analogy) but via changes in the dynamics of those concentrations (the signals are FM or frequency-modulated). This contributes in principle to a straightforward solution of the crosstalk problem, leads to a profound reassessment of how to understand the downstream effects of dynamic changes in the concentrations of elements in these pathways, and stresses the role of signal processing (and not merely the intermediates) in biological signalling. It is this signal processing that lies at the heart of understanding the languages of cells. The resolution of many of the modern and postgenomic problems of biochemistry requires the development of a myriad of new technologies (and maybe a new culture), and thus regular input from the physical sciences, engineering, mathematics and computer science. One solution, that we are adopting in the Manchester Interdisciplinary Biocentre (http://www.mib.ac.uk/) and the Manchester Centre for Integrative Systems Biology (http://www.mcisb.org/), is thus to colocate individuals with the necessary combinations of skills. Novel disciplines that require such an integrative approach continue to emerge. These include fields such as chemical genomics, synthetic biology, distributed computational environments for biological data and modelling, single cell diagnostics/bionanotechnology, and computational linguistics/text mining."}},{"pk": "14148", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "22", "pubYear": 2006, "doi": "10.1093/bioinformatics/btk018", "sbw": 0, "title": "Synthetic biology: Challenges ahead", "pubMonth": "1", "journal": 1171, "abstract": ""}},{"pk": "14154", "model": "librarian.paper", "fields": {"volume": "12", "pubYear": 2006, "doi": "10.1016/j.bbmt.2005.09.013", "sbw": 0, "title": "Engineering novel diagnostic modalities and implantable cytomimetic nanomaterials for next-generation medicine", "pubMonth": "1", "journal": 14153, "abstract": "The advent of 21st century medicine mill be based on a comprehensive approach to achieving the highly sensitive and specific detection of diseases, as well as the development of novel materials and devices based on biotic-abiotic interfacing as interventional modalities.

However, the conservation can be a result of many factors such as vertical inheritance, or functional selection. Thus, identification of conserved gene clusters that are under functional selection provides an effective channel for gene annotation, microarray screening, and pathway reconstruction. The problem of devising a robust method to identify these conserved gene clusters and to evaluate the significance of the conservation in multiple genomes has a number of implications for comparative, evolutionary and functional genomics as well as synthetic biology. Results: In this paper we describe a new method for detecting conserved gene clusters that incorporates the information captured by a genome phylogenetic tree. We show that our method can overcome the common problem of overestimation of significance due to the bias in the genome database and thereby achieve better accuracy when detecting functionally connected gene clusters. Our results can be accessed at database GeneChords http://genomics10.bu.edu/GeneChords. Conclusion: The methodology described in this paper gives a scalable framework for discovering conserved gene clusters in microbial genomes.

Reported here is a solution to this problem. The solution replaces thymidine triphosphate by 2-thiothymidine triphosphate (2-thioTTP). Because of the bulk and hydrogen bonding properties of the thione unit in 2-thioT, 2-thioT does not mispair effectively with the minor tautomer of isoG. To test whether this might allow PCR amplification of a six-letter artificially expanded genetic information system, we examined the relative rates of misincorporation of 2-thioTTP and TTP opposite isoG using affinity electrophoresis. The concentrations of isoCTP and 2-thioTTP were optimal to best support PCR amplification using thermostable polymerases of a six-letter alphabet that includes the isoC-isoG pair. The fidelity-per-round of amplification was found to be similar to 98% in trial PCRs with this six-letter DNA alphabet.

The receiver cells contain a pulse-generator circuit that incorporates a feed-forward regulatory motif. The circuit responds to a long-lasting increase in the level of AHL by transiently activating, and then repressing, the expression of a GFP.

The ability to differentiate between various rates of increase in inducer concentrations affords the system a unique spatiotemporal behavior for cells grown on solid media. Specifically, receiver cells can respond to communication from nearby sender cells while completely ignoring communication from senders cells further away, despite the fact that AHL concentrations eventually reach high levels everywhere.

The relevance of these researches, considering that the minimal cell should also correspond to the early simple cell in the origin of life and early evolution, is also explained. In addition, we present detailed data in relation to minimal genome, with observations cited by several authors who agree on setting the theoretical full-fledged minimal genome to a figure between 200 and 300 genes. However, further theoretical assumptions may significantly reduce this number (i.e. by eliminating ribosomal proteins and by limiting DNA and RNA polymerases to only a few, less specific molecular species). Generally, the experimental approach to minimal cells consists in utilizing liposomes as cell models and in filling them with genes/enzymes corresponding to minimal cellular functions. To date, a few research groups have successfully induced the expression of single proteins, such as the green fluorescence protein, inside liposomes. Here, different approaches are described and compared. Present constructs are still rather far from the minimal cell, and experimental as well as theoretical difficulties opposing further reduction of complexity are discussed. While most of these minimal cell constructions may represent relatively poor imitations of a modern full-fledged cell, further studies will begin precisely from these constructs.

Instead, variation is dominated by differences in the capacity of individual cells to transmit signals through the pathway ('pathway capacity') and to express proteins from genes ('expression capacity').

We sought to quantitatively investigate the extent to which the occurrence of molecular fluctuations within single cells (biochemical noise) could explain the variation of gene expression levels between cells in a genetically identical population (phenotypic noise).
